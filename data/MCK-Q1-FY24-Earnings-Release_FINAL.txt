      “Our strong first quarter results reflect continued momentum across our business, led by the dedication 
and commitment of over 50,000 Team McKesson employees,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “Our 
performance in the quarter further demonstrates operating execution and continued focus on our strategy. We 
remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth. Based on the strong first quarter and our outlook 
for the remainder of the year, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted 
Share to $26.55 to $27.35.” 
       
      First quarter revenues were $74.5 billion, an increase of 11% from a year ago, primarily driven by 
growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher 
volumes from retail national account customers and specialty and GLP-1 products, partially offset by lower 
revenues in the International segment as a result of the divestitures of McKesson's European businesses.

      First quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $7.02 compared to $5.25 a year 
ago, an increase of $1.77. 
 
      First quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $7.27 compared to $5.83 a year ago, an 
increase of 25%, driven by a lower tax rate, lower share count, and growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and 
Prescription Technology Solutions segments. First quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share also included 
pre-tax losses of approximately $7 million associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, compared 
to pre-tax losses of approximately $22 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
      For the first three months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $770 million of cash to shareholders, 
which included $696 million of common stock repurchases and $74 million of dividend payments. During the 
first three months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $1.1 billion, and invested $124 
million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $1.2 billion. 
 
Business Highlights 
   •  McKesson maintains a disciplined approach to capital allocation, centered on delivering sustainable 
      growth and long-term shareholder value. On July 21, 2023, the Board of Directors: 

         o  Declared a 15% increase to its quarterly dividend from $0.54 per share to $0.62 per share. 

         o  Approved the company to repurchase up to an additional $6.0 billion of its common shares to a 
            total authorization of $8.9 billion as of July 2023, in a manner and timing deemed in the best 
            interest of the company and its stockholders, considering factors such as other growth 
            opportunities and prevailing business and market conditions. 
   •  In July 2023, The US Oncology Network expanded its footprint with the addition of the Cancer Center of 
      Kansas, strengthening its market leading position in community oncology practices and growing its total 
      number of providers to over 2,400.  
   •  McKesson released its latest Impact Report for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, showcasing its ongoing 
      commitment to advancing health outcomes for all. The report describes McKesson’s continued efforts 
      to track, measure, and communicate its progress in achieving its corporate purpose, with a focus on 
      how the company is making an impact with its people, partners, community, and planet. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Revenues were $67.2 billion, an increase of 18%, driven by increased prescription volumes, including 
      higher volumes from retail national account customers and specialty and GLP-1 products, partially 
      offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $827 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $771 million, an 
      increase of 8%, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health 
      systems and increased contributions from our generics program. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 
      vaccine distribution from fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit growth of 14%. 
 
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 17%, driven by growth in our third-party logistics and 
      technology services businesses due to increased prescription volumes. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $231 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $223 million, an 
      increase of 35%, driven by increasing demand for access solutions, primarily related to prior 
      authorization services due to increased prescription volumes. 
 
 
 
 


                                              
       

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by growth in the extended and primary care 
      businesses, including growth in lab and equipment, and specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by 
      lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary 
      supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $227 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $235 million, a 
      decrease of 12%, driven by lower contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies 
      for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items 
      from fiscal 2023, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered Adjusted Segment Operating Profit 
      growth of 7%, driven by growth in the extended and primary care businesses.  
 
International Segment 
   •  Revenues were $3.5 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, 
      driven by the divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $57 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $95 million, a decrease of 31%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson's European 
      businesses. 
   
Fiscal 2024 Outlook 
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the Company is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort. McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO 
inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and 
related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are generally 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, and as such, any 
associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.  
       
      McKesson is raising fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $26.55 to $27.35 
from the previous range of $26.10 to $26.90 to reflect strong first quarter performance and outlook in the North 
American businesses. 
       
      Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes ($0.04) related to year-to-date 
losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments. 
       
      Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share Excluding Certain Items guidance indicates 13% to 
16% forecasted growth compared to prior year. 
 
      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In  an  effort  to  provide  investors  with  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's  financial  results  as  determined  by 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP"),  McKesson  Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "we")  also  presents  the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•   Adjusted  Gross  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Gross  Profit  as  GAAP  gross  profit,  excluding  transaction-
    related  expenses  and  adjustments,  last-in,  first-out  (“LIFO”)  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal 
    settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating 
    expenses,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Other  Income  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Other  Income  as  GAAP  other  income  (expense),  net, 
    excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  and  other 
    adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Interest  Expense  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Interest  Expense  as  GAAP  interest  expense,  excluding 
    transaction-related expenses and adjustments related to net interest expense incurred from cross-currency swaps used to 
    hedge  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  notes  resulting  from  changes  in 
    benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency-denominated notes were previously 
    designated  as  non-derivative  net  investment  hedges  of  portions  of  the  Company's  net  investments  in  its  now-divested 
    European businesses against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the 
    U.S. dollar.

•   Adjusted Income Tax Expense (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Income Tax Expense as GAAP income tax benefit 
    (expense), excluding the income tax effects of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses 
    and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and 
    related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. Income tax effects are calculated in accordance with 
    Accounting  Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  740,  “Income  Taxes,”  which  is  the  same  accounting  principle  used  by  the 
    Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

•   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable 
    to  McKesson,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, 
    claims  and  litigation  charges,  other  adjustments  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as 
    applicable. 

•   Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share as GAAP earnings 
    per  diluted  common  share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  McKesson,  excluding  per  share  impacts  of 
    amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related 
    adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and  litigation 
    charges,  other  adjustments  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as  applicable,  divided  by 
    diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

•   Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  Excluding  Certain  Items  (Non-GAAP):  Prior  to  fiscal  2024,  we  defined 
    Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  Excluding  Certain  Items  as  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  (Non-GAAP), 
    excluding the impacts of the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program, the U.S. government's kitting, 
    storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines program, sales of COVID-19 tests, net gains and 
    losses  associated  with  McKesson  Ventures'  equity  investments,  and  the  gain  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended 
    December  31,  2022  related  to  termination  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  ("TRA")  with  Change  Healthcare  Inc. 
    ("Change"), as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable, divided by diluted weighted-
    average shares outstanding. Beginning in fiscal 2024, we define Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share Excluding Certain 
    Items as Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP), excluding the impacts of net gains and losses associated with 
    McKesson Ventures' equity investments and the gain recognized related to termination of the TRA with Change, as well as

    acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains 
    from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments. We define Adjusted 
    Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  as  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP)  divided  by  GAAP  segment 
    revenues.

•   Adjusted Corporate Expenses (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Corporate Expenses as GAAP corporate expenses, net, 
    excluding  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and 
    litigation charges, and other adjustments.

    related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring,

    The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-

    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  -  Transaction,  integration,  and  other  expenses  that  are  directly  related  to

                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change 
    our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted 
    as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure 
    or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, 
    and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product 
    line,  reorganization  or  management  structure  changes,  headcount  rationalization,  realignment  of  operations  or  products, 
    integration  of  acquired  businesses,  and/or  company-wide  cost  saving  initiatives.  The  amount  and/or  frequency  of  these 
    restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
    Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

    Claims  and  litigation  charges  -  Adjustments  to  certain  of  the  Company’s  reserves,  including  those  related  to  estimated 
    probable  settlements  for  its  controlled  substance  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  opioid-related  claims,  as  well  as  any 
    applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees 
    to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred. This also may include charges or credits for general non-operational 
    claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on 
    an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-
    inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other 
    similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

    The  Company  evaluates  the  aforementioned  Non-GAAP  measures  on  a  periodic  basis  and  updates  the  definitions  from 
    time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-
    GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided 
    in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an 
    FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our 
    operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
    currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-
    Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and 
    adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
    Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
    tables included with this release.

•   Free  Cash  Flow  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  (used  in)  operating  activities  less 
    payments  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
    consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-
    GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with 
regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s 
future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability 
to  compare  its  financial  results  to  those  of  other  companies  in  the  same  industry.  However,  the  Company's  Non-GAAP 
measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well 
as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pound sterling. As a result, the comparability 
of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information  to  provide  a  framework  for  assessing  how  our  business  performed  excluding  the  estimated  effect  of  foreign 
currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  useful  to  investors  as  a 
supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic 
acquisitions,  dividend  payments,  or  other  strategic  uses  of  cash.  Nonetheless,  Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-
GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a  substitute  for,  nor  superior  to,  financial  results  and 
measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
