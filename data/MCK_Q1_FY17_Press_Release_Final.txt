      SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2016 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2016 were 
$49.7 billion, up 5% compared to $47.5 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), first-quarter earnings per 
diluted share from continuing operations was $2.88 compared to $2.50 a year 
ago.  
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.50, up 11% as 
compared to $3.14 a year ago. First-quarter results included: a pre-tax gain of 
$142 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, related to cash receipts representing 
our share of antitrust settlement proceeds within Distribution Solutions; $37 
million, or 16 cents per diluted share, in discrete tax benefits related to the 
company’s adoption of amended guidance by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board on accounting for share-based compensation; and pre-tax 
charges totaling $9 million, or approximately 2 cents per diluted share, related to 
the company’s cost alignment plan as disclosed in March 2016 (the “Cost 
Alignment Plan”). Prior year first-quarter results included: a pre-tax gain of $51 
million, or 16 cents per diluted share, related to the sale of the nurse triage 
business within Technology Solutions; and $59 million, or 15 cents per diluted 
share, related to antitrust settlement proceeds within Distribution Solutions. 


                                   1 
      “McKesson’s first-quarter operating results represent a solid start to the 
fiscal year, consistent with our expectations,” said John H. Hammergren, 
chairman and chief executive officer.  
      For the first quarter, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.9 
billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion. 
During the quarter, McKesson paid $1.8 billion for acquisitions, $66 million in 
dividends and had internal capital spending of $114 million.  
      “We operate businesses that continue to produce strong cash flow 
results,” continued Hammergren. “Our management team is focused on driving 
long-term value for our shareholders. We were pleased to have successfully 
closed several acquisitions during the quarter, further extending our strong track 
record of value creation through our portfolio approach to capital deployment.” 
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.0 billion for the quarter, up 5% 
both on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $41.2 
billion for the quarter were up 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant 
currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth, acquisitions and our mix of 
business. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.3 
billion for the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency 
basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth. 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up 2% for the 
quarter, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE 
Medical business in the second quarter of Fiscal 2016.  
      In the first quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $928 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.89%. First-quarter adjusted operating 
profit was $1.1 billion, down 1% from the prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.29% on a 
constant currency basis.  


                                   2 
      Technology Solutions revenues were down 2% on a reported basis and 
1% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter, primarily driven by an 
anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business and the prior 
year sale of the nurse triage business in the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, partially 
offset by growth in our other technology businesses.  
      Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $168 million for the first 
quarter and GAAP operating margin was 23.20%. On a constant currency basis, 
adjusted operating profit was $179 million for the first quarter and adjusted 
operating margin was 24.69%. 
 
Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook 
      McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share between $10.70 to 
$11.60 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, which includes the following 
items: 
   •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.25 to $1.35 per 
      diluted share; 
   •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 50 cents to 65 cents per 
      diluted share; 
   •  LIFO inventory-related charges of 40 cents to 60 cents per diluted share; 
      and 
   •  Claim and litigation reserve credits of 2 cents per diluted share for average 
      wholesale price litigation matters. 
       
      Excluding approximately 12 to 15 cents in expected charges to Adjusted 
Earnings for the Cost Alignment Plan, McKesson expects $13.43 to $13.93 per 
diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  
      The Fiscal 2017 guidance ranges do not include any potential claim or 
litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
divestitures, and impairments or material restructurings beyond those previously 
publicly disclosed. 
 
                         


                                   3 
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim 
and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting changes to the company’s reserves 
for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation 
matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A 
reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is 
provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with 
this release. 
 
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
      acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and 
      Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business 
      acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions 
      and the proposed Healthcare Technology net asset exchange by the Company.  Examples include transaction closing costs, professional 
      service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related 
      expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign 
      currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
