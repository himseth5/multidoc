      Third-quarter revenues were $70.5 billion, an increase of 3% from a year ago, primarily driven by 
growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, including 
retail national account customers, market growth, and strength across the oncology platform including 
increased patient visits, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the 
completed divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses.  
 
      Third-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $7.65 compared to loss per 
diluted share from continuing operations of ($0.04) a year ago, an increase of $7.69, due to an after-tax charge 
of $829 million for the fair value remeasurement related to McKesson's agreement to sell its UK business in 
the third-quarter of fiscal 2022.  
 
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.90 compared to $6.15 a year ago, an 
increase of 12%, driven by lower corporate expenses, including a pre-tax benefit of $126 million associated 
with the termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, lower share count, and growth 
across the North American businesses.  
 
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $3.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $216 million of dividend payments. During the 
first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.8 billion, and invested 
more than $300 million in capital expenditures, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $1.5 billion. 
 
Business Highlights  
   •  McKesson was recognized by Newsweek as one of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 
      2023. 
   •  The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has approved McKesson's near-term science-based 
      greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets. The targets validated by SBTi are to: 
         ◦  Reduce direct GHG emissions 50% by fiscal 2032 from a fiscal 2020 base year 
         ◦  Ensure 70% of McKesson suppliers, by spend covering purchased goods and services, will 
            have their own SBTi-approved GHG reduction targets by fiscal 2027 
   •  McKesson continued to expand its differentiated oncology and biopharma businesses, further 
      demonstrating meaningful progress against its company priorities.  
         ◦  On October 31, 2022, McKesson and HCA Healthcare completed the formation of a joint 
            venture combining McKesson’s US Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare’s Sarah Cannon 
            Research Institute and on November 1, 2022, McKesson completed the acquisition of Rx 
            Savings Solutions.  
         ◦  The US Oncology Network expanded its footprint into local communities with the addition of two 
            large multidisciplinary practices, Epic Care and Nexus Health. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $61.9 billion, an increase of 13%, driven by increased volume of specialty 
      products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, and market growth, partially 
      offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $850 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $778 
      million, an increase of 6%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health 
      systems. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment 
      delivered Adjusted Segment Operating Profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty 
      products to providers and health systems and improvements in pharmaceutical prescription volumes 
      and oncology visits. 
 
 


                                              
        

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by growth in prescription volumes in 
      our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $136 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $155 
      million, an increase of 7%, driven by growth in access, affordability, and adherence solutions. During

      for sustainable long-term growth. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $3.0 billion, a decrease of 3%, driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests 
      and lower contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. 
      government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, partially offset by growth in the primary care business. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $328 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $336 
      million, an increase of 2%, driven by growth in the primary care business and organic business 
      performance, partially offset by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, 
      storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program. 
      Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit growth of 25%, driven by growth in the primary care business, 
      including illness season testing, and favorable sourcing activities. 
  
International Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $4.4 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $4.9 billion, a 
      decrease of 48%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $136 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $158 million, a decrease of 29%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP 
financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted 
Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted Income Tax 
Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
Excluding Certain Items, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, 
Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results, and Free Cash Flow which are 
financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial 
Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the 
Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences 
between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
       
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably 
forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, 
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s 
control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements  
      This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements 
may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” 
“seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “estimates,” “targets” or the negative of these words or 
other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, guidance, trends, strategy, plans, 
assumptions, or intentions, and our greenhouse gas emission targets may also include forward-looking 
statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial 
performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by 
law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and 
uncertainties, we encourage investors to read the risk factors described in our most recent annual and periodic 
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation or 
challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, 
intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might

difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing 
and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and 
we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russo-Ukrainian War on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access 
to credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we 
might be adversely impacted by monetary inflation or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might 
be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the 
effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events (such as the 
Russo-Ukrainian War) and other catastrophic events; we may not achieve our GHG emissions reduction 
targets; SBTi may not validate a sufficient number of our suppliers’ GHG reduction targets; we may incur 
additional costs or operational impacts related to our GHG reduction initiatives; we may be adversely affected 
by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; and we face

                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Claims and litigation charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes:
     •   pre-tax charges of $112 million ($93 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims 
         of governmental entities, including Native American tribes;
     •   a pre-tax charge of $27 million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims 
         with the State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties; and
     •   a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive 
         proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of participating states, their political subdivisions, and other 
         governmental entities.
   These charges are included within Corporate expenses, net and under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation 
   of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(8) Other adjustments, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 includes a pre-tax gain of $97 million 
   ($72 million after-tax) within Corporate expenses, net from termination of fixed interest rate swaps accounted for as 
   cash  flow  hedges.  Management  believes  that  this  gain  is  not  part  of  normal  business  operations  and  is  therefore 
   excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  This  gain  is  included  under  "other  income,  net"  in  the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

(9) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million ($141 
   million  after-tax)  on  debt  extinguishment  within  Corporate  expenses,  net  related  to  our  July  2021  tender  offer  to 
   redeem  a  portion  of  our  then-existing  debt.  This  charge  is  included  under  "loss  on  debt  extinguishment"  in  the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical Solutions. These charges were driven by the intent of management to not sell this excess inventory which 
   required  inventory  write  downs  to  zero  net  realizable  value,  and  instead  direct  it  to  charitable  organizations  or 
   otherwise dispose. A portion of this inventory was committed for donation to charitable organizations during our first 
   quarter of fiscal 2022, which was delivered during fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this inventory which was no longer 
   intended for sale in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of normal business 
   operations  and  is  therefore  excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  A  pre-tax  charge  of  $147  million 
   ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which we no longer 
   planned to sell, and a pre-tax charge of $8 million ($6 million after-tax) is included under "total operating expenses" 
   related  to  the  completed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11) Net losses (gains) associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments for the nine months ended December 31, 
   2022 and 2021 included pre-tax net losses of $24 million ($18 million after-tax) and pre-tax net gains of $104 million 
   ($77 million after-tax), respectively, within Corporate expenses, net. These amounts were recorded in “Other income, 
   net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (GAAP) provided in Schedule 1 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(12) Termination  of  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  ("TRA")  with  Change  Healthcare  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended 
   December 31, 2022 consists of a pre-tax gain of $126 million ($93 million after-tax) within Corporate expenses, net, 
   related  to  a  cash  payment  received  as  a  result  of  an  exercise  of  the  option  by  Change  Healthcare  Inc.  ("Change") 
   pursuant to the TRA for early termination of the agreement. We entered into this agreement as part of the formation of 
   a joint venture with Change, from which McKesson has since exited. This amount was recorded in “Other income, 
   net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (GAAP) provided in Schedule 1 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees  to  defend  claims,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  This  also  may  include  charges  or  credits  for  general  non-
   operational claims not directly related to our ongoing business.
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, Canadian dollars, and British pound 
sterling. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
