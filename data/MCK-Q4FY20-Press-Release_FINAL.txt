      “McKesson delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2020, reflecting continued momentum in the 
business and meaningful progress in our transformation towards becoming a more focused organization 
as we look to capture future growth opportunities,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive offer. “During fiscal 
2020, we achieved adjusted operating profit growth in all three operating segments, generated $3.9 
billion of free cash flow, and successfully completed the exit of our investment in Change Healthcare.” 

                                            
 
 

      “As we enter fiscal 2021, McKesson is leveraging our expertise, leadership and scale to play a 
critical role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr. Tyler continued. “We continue to remain 
focused on supporting our people, our customers and our communities during this challenging time. I 
want to thank caregivers worldwide for their heroic efforts and acknowledge the entire McKesson team, 
particularly our frontline workers, for their extraordinary dedication. Despite the uncertainties in the near-
term macro environment, we remain confident in the resiliency of our business model and committed to 
creating long-term shareholder value.”    
       
      Fourth-quarter revenues were $58.5 billion, up 12%, and full-year revenues were $231.1 billion, 
up 8%, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, largely due to 
branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from retail national account customers.  
       
      Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share of $5.82 included an after-tax gain of $414 million, 
recognized upon the separation of the company’s investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change 
Healthcare”). Full-year earnings per diluted share of $4.99 also included after-tax impairment and dilution 
charges of $1 billion related to Change Healthcare and after-tax charges of $275 million within our 
European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment for the remeasurement to fair value of assets and liabilities 
held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens 
Boots Alliance.  
       
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $4.27 compared to $3.69 a year ago, an 
increase of 16%, primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in the European Pharmaceutical 
Solutions segment. Full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $14.95 compared to $13.57 a year 
ago, an increase of 10%, primarily driven by a lower share count and growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical 
and Specialty Solutions and Medical Surgical segments, partially offset by higher corporate expenses 
and the lapping of a prior year pre-tax benefit of $90 million related to a reversal of a contractual liability 
associated with McKesson’s investment in Change Healthcare. 
       
      For the full year, McKesson returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders via $1.9 billion of 
common stock repurchases and $294 million of dividend payments. During the fiscal year, McKesson 
generated cash from operations of $4.4 billion, and invested $506 million internally, resulting in free cash 
flow of $3.9 billion.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Earnings, FX-
Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with 
GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying 

                                            
 
 

financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial 
measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is 
unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most 
directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson 
cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements 
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute 
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as 
financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent 
required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, 
“anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the 
negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, 
plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors 
to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
       
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal 
disputes, including legal disputes, government actions and adverse publicity regarding our role in 
distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might experience losses not covered by insurance; 
we are subject to extensive, complex and challenging healthcare, controlled substance, privacy, anti-
corruption and other laws; we might record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, intangibles 
and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant 
computer system compromises or data breaches or other significant problems with information systems 
or networks, including as an effect of our employees working from remote locations due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we might be harmed by large 
customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our contracts with government 
entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by changes in our relationships 
or contracts with suppliers; we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees; we 
might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement 
models; we might be adversely impacted by competition and industry consolidation; we might be 
adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and we may have difficulties in sourcing 
or selling products due to a variety of causes, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply 
chains; we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we 

                                            
 
 

might be adversely impacted, including as an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, by an economic 
slowdown or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets might impede our access credit, 
increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we 
might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions, and we might not 
realize the expected tax treatment from our split-off of Change Healthcare; we might be adversely 
impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including volatility due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public 
health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other

(c)  Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $4.29, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.02.
(d)  We calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 using a weighted average of 191 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate 
     Adjusted Earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 192 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any cross-footing 
     differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts.

                            FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(10) Equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture includes our proportionate share of 
   loss from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture within Other. Such amount includes the amortization of equity 
   investment intangibles and other acquired intangibles of $64 million and $75 million for the three months ended March 
   31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 and $267 million and $304 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019. 
   These charges are included under "Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles" in the reconciliation of McKesson's 
   GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2A and Schedule 2B of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(11) Equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture for the three months and year ended 
   March 31, 2020 includes an estimated gain of $414 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within Other recognized upon the 
   separation of our investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change Healthcare"). The separation was completed on March 
   10, 2020 and involved a series of transactions, including an exchange offer to split-off our wholly-owned subsidiary PF2 
   SpinCo, Inc. ("SpinCo") which held all of McKesson's interest in Change Healthcare and a merger of SpinCo with and 
   into Change Healthcare, Inc. ("Change"). McKesson no longer holds an interest in any securities of Change Healthcare 
   or Change following the transactions. After the separation, Change Healthcare is required under an agreement to pay 
   McKesson 85% of the net cash tax savings realized, or so deemed, from the depreciation or amortization allocated to 
   Change by McKesson. The receipt of any payments from this agreement is dependent upon Change benefiting from this 
   depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings, which creates uncertainty such that McKesson accounts for the 
   agreement as a gain contingency. This estimated gain is included under "Transaction-Related Expenses and Adjustments" 
   in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2A 
   and Schedule 2B of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(12) Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2020 includes net discrete tax benefits of $21 million recognized in 
   connection with an agreement executed in December 2019 to settle all opioids related claims filed by two Ohio counties. 
   Income tax expense for the three months and year ended March 31, 2019 includes net discrete tax expenses of $54 million 
   and net discrete tax benefits of $424 million recognized in connection with the 2017 Tax Act. These discrete tax expenses 
   and benefits are included under "Other Adjustments, Net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP financial results to 
   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2A and Schedule 2B of the accompanying financial statement 
   tables.
                                                                                                      1 of 2

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally 
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-
GAAP measures in this press release. 

•   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to 
    McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, last-in, 
    first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related 
    charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company 
    evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation 
    considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation 
    of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial 
    statement tables included with this release.

    Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
    combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering 
    costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, retention payments 
    and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred 
    revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge 
    loan fees, and gains or losses on business combinations and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued 
    operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

    Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

    Restructuring, impairment and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our 
    operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
    well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or 
    consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and 
    other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, 
    reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration 
    of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring 
    charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit 
    adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from Adjusted Earnings.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an 
    individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, 
    other adjustments may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; 
    other asset impairments; certain discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment 
    of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent 
    items as deemed appropriate. Prior to fiscal 2020, this category also included certain gains or losses from divestitures of 
    businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations.

    Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, 
    “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted 
    items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted earnings per diluted 
    share.
                                                                                                      2 of 2

                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial 
    results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are 
    recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable 
    prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign 
    currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from 
    quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings 
    (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments 
    for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated statements 
    of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 
    6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard 
to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future 
financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare 
its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the 
press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, 
deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of 
our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure 
as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend 
payments or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company 
should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
