      SAN FRANCISCO, May 24, 2018 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the fourth quarter ended March 
31, 2018, were $51.6 billion, up 6% compared to $48.7 billion a year ago. On 
a constant currency basis, revenues increased 4% over the prior year. For the 
fiscal year, McKesson had revenues of $208.4 billion, up 5% compared to 
$198.5 billion a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 
4% over the prior year. 
      On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”), fourth-quarter loss per diluted share from continuing operations 
was $(5.58), compared to earnings per diluted share of $16.79 a year ago. 
Full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was 
$0.30, compared to $23.28 a year ago. Fourth-quarter GAAP loss per diluted 
share and full-year GAAP earnings per share included after-tax net charges 
totaling $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, or $9.07 and $12.32 per 
diluted share, respectively, driven primarily by non-cash goodwill and long-
lived asset impairment charges in the company’s European and Canadian 
retail businesses, partially offset by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act of 2017.  
      Prior year fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share 
included an after-tax net gain of $3.0 billion, or $14.10 per diluted share and 


                                  1 
$13.53 per diluted share, respectively, related to the creation of the Change 
Healthcare joint venture. 
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.49, up 2% 
compared to $3.41 a year ago. Full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted share 
was $12.62, up 1% compared to $12.54 for the prior year, which includes the 
$0.31 per diluted share contribution to create a non-profit foundation. 
      For the full year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $4.3 
billion and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion. 
During the year, McKesson repaid approximately $765 million in net long-term 
debt, paid $2.9 billion for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.7 billion 
of its common stock, invested $580 million internally and paid $262 million in 
dividends.” 
      “While we realized significant charges in the fourth quarter reflecting 
challenging market conditions in Europe and Canada, I’m pleased with the 
Fiscal 2018 performance across our other businesses. And the strength of our 
balance sheet and cash flow enabled us to make internal investments and 
acquisitions that will drive growth,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and 
chief executive officer. “This strong financial position, combined with actions 
we are taking in relation to our recently announced multi-year strategic growth 
initiative, ensures McKesson’s ongoing focus on delivering shareholder value.  
      “We also returned capital to shareholders through share repurchases 
and a quarterly dividend. And yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an 
additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, as we believe that the 
company’s shares are an attractive investment opportunity and repurchasing 
stock is an important part of our diversified capital allocation strategy,” 
continued Hammergren.  
       
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $51.6 billion for the quarter, up 
7% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. For the full

basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of

                                  2 
currency basis. For the full year, North America pharmaceutical distribution 
and services revenues were $174.2 billion, up 6% on both a reported and 
constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. Revenue growth for the 
quarter and the full year was driven primarily by market growth and 
acquisitions, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were 
$7.2 billion for the quarter, up 19% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant 
currency basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth, which were the 
same factors that drove full year revenues of $27.3 billion, up 10% on a 
reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior 
year. 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.7 billion 
for the quarter, up 9%, driven primarily by market growth, including the impact 
of a stronger flu season. For the full year, Medical-Surgical distribution and 
services revenues were $6.6 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year. 
      Fourth-quarter Distribution Solutions GAAP operating loss was $(689) 
million and GAAP operating margin was (1.33)%. On a constant currency 
basis, fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 8% from the 
prior year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted 
operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.26% on a 
constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling 
interests for the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.17% on a constant 
currency basis. 
      For the full year, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $1.2 
billion and GAAP operating margin was 0.59%. On a constant currency basis, 
full-year adjusted operating profit was $4.1 billion, up 8% from the prior year 
on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating 
margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.96% on a constant 
currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling interests 
for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.87% on a constant currency 
basis. 
      Fourth-quarter Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $23 
million. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $72 million, driven by the 


                                  3 
company’s proportionate share of the income from McKesson’s equity 
investment in Change Healthcare.  
      Full-year Technology Solutions GAAP operating loss was $(23) million. 
Full-year adjusted operating profit was $304 million, primarily driven by the 
company’s proportionate share of the income from McKesson’s equity 
investment in Change Healthcare. 
       
Fiscal Year 2018 Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Earnings  
      Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.62 for the fiscal year ending

      long-lived asset impairment charges; and 
   •  Other adjustment net charges of $6.01 per diluted share, primarily

      by benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. 
 
Revised Segment Financial Reporting Effective Fiscal Year 2019 
      Following the retirement of the president of Distribution Solutions in 
January 2018 and an evaluation of the company’s management and operating 
structure, McKesson has revised its reportable segments commencing in the 
first quarter of Fiscal 2019. McKesson’s new reportable segments are: 
   •  U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, which includes the U.S. 
      Pharmaceutical and McKesson Specialty Health businesses; 
   •  European Pharmaceutical Solutions; and 
   •  Medical-Surgical Solutions.  
      All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not 
significant enough to require reportable segment disclosure will be included in 
Other. Other primarily includes McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription 


                                  4 
Technology Solutions (MRxTS) and the company’s equity method investment 
in Change Healthcare. 
   Please refer to a second 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for historical supplemental information for the fiscal years ending 
March 31, 2018; March 31, 2017; and March 31, 2016 reflecting historical 
results by revised reportable segment.  
 
Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook  
      McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to 
$13.80 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. 
      “Our Fiscal 2019 outlook represents mid- to high-single digit 
percentage growth year over year, reflecting a more stable market 
environment and effective capital allocation, while including the previously 
outlined headwinds in our European and Rexall businesses,” Hammergren 
concluded. 
      McKesson has ceased providing forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this 
forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-
looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the 
company’s control. 
 
Key Assumptions for Fiscal 2019 
      The Fiscal 2019 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and 
is also subject to the Risk Factors outlined below: 
   •  McKesson to deliver mid-single digit percent revenue growth and down 
      slightly to up mid-single digit percent adjusted income from operations 
      growth in Fiscal 2019. 
   •  U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions to deliver low- to mid-
      single digit percent revenue growth and flat to down mid-single digit 
      percent adjusted operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019. 
   •  European Pharmaceutical Solutions to deliver flat to mid-single digit 
      percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019. 


                                  5 
•  Medical-Surgical Solutions is expected to deliver low-double digit 
   percent revenue growth and mid- to high-single digit percent adjusted 
   operating profit growth in Fiscal 2019.  
•  Other is expected to deliver low-single digit percent revenue growth 
   and adjusted operating profit to be flat in Fiscal 2019, which includes a 
   gross headwind of between $100 million and $120 million related to the 
   generic pricing initiative the Canadian provincial governments enacted 
   April 1, 2018, as well as the impact of an increase in minimum wage in 
   multiple provinces. 
•  Adjusted equity earnings from the company’s investment in Change 
   Healthcare are expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digit percent 
   in Fiscal 2019. 
•  Expect low-double digit percent decline in corporate expenses 
   compared to Fiscal 2018. 
•  Interest expense is expected to decline year over year. 
•  The guidance range assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate of 
   approximately 21% to 23%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.  
•  Income attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to decline 
   year over year.  
•  The company’s ownership position in McKesson Europe is assumed to 
   be approximately 77% for Fiscal 2019. 
•  Foreign currency exchange rate movements are assumed to have a 
   net favorable impact of up to 10 cents per diluted share year over year.  
•  Commencing in Fiscal 2019, the company will provide free cash flow 
   guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.0 billion, 
   which is net of expected property acquisitions and capitalized software 
   expenditures of between $600 million and $800 million. 
•  Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings 
   per share are expected to be approximately 200 million for the year. 
                 
                      


                               6 
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as 
GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and 
adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal 
settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 
      The company will not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related 
adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and 
other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are 
inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are 
beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its 
impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
       
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency 
basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, 
including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the 
comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected 
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency 
information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the 
company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant currency information 
of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) 
is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 
 


                                  7 
Non-GAAP Measures 
      McKesson also provides adjusted operating profit margin excluding 
noncontrolling interests. The company has arrangements involving third-party 
noncontrolling interests. As a result, pre-tax results are affected by the portion 
of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted operating 
profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information is presented to 
provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed 
excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. 
The supplemental adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling 
interests information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
tables included with this release. 
      McKesson also provides a free cash flow estimate on a forward-looking 
basis. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities 
less property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined 
in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

(1)  2018, as reported under GAAP, includes non-cash goodwill impairment charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of $933 million for our McKesson Europe reporting unit and $455 million for our Rexall Health reporting unit. The 2018 goodwill 
     impairment charges are recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. 
(2)  2018, as reported under GAAP, includes pre-tax asset impairment charges of $290 million ($286 million after-tax) and pre-tax restructuring charges of $21 million ($22 million after-tax) primarily representing employee severance and lease 
     exit costs. These charges are included within our Distribution Solutions segment.
(3)  The amortization of equity investment intangibles and other acquired intangibles of $74 million is included in our proportionate share of the income (loss) from our equity method investment in Change Healthcare. 2018, as reported under 
     GAAP, includes our proportionate share of benefits recognized by Change Healthcare related to the 2017 Tax Act of $76 million. 
(4)  2018, as reported under GAAP, includes a pre-tax loss of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) on debt extinguishment related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing debt.
(5)  2018, as reported under GAAP, includes net discrete tax benefits of $54 million related to the 2017 Tax Act. 
(6)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. Any cross-footing differences in per share amounts is due to a difference in weighted average shares outstanding in calculating GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net income.
(7)  2018 fourth quarter diluted net loss per share as reported under GAAP, is calculated using a weighted average of 206 million common shares and excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects. Potentially 
     dilutive securities were excluded from the 2018 GAAP per share computations due to our reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018. Diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP), and GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items, are 
     calculated using a weighted average of 207 million common shares and includes dilutive securities.  
(8)  Adjusted Earnings per share on a Constant Currency basis for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.45 per diluted share, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.04 per diluted share.
(9)  2017, as reported under GAAP, includes a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million ($3,018 million after-tax), net, recognized from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange within our Technology Solutions segment.

                                     SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

      In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
 accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
 release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
 its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
 Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    •  Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
       excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) 
       inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, other adjustments as well as the related 
       income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis 
       and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s 
       presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided 
       in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

       Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
       and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.

       Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
       combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  Examples include transaction closing 
       costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and  employee relocation expenses, 
       facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, 
       recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency 
       contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net 
       Asset Exchange.

       LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

       Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

       Restructuring charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, 
       the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted. Such charges may include 
       employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, 
       accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale 
       or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of 
       operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are 
       not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to 
       subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded. These restructuring charges are reflected under various captions within our 
       operating expenses.

       Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
       basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
       may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
       assets; asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses; certain discrete benefits related to 
       the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar 
       substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

       Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
       which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

       Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                           2 of 2
                               SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    •  Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
       our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
       exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
       estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
       which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
       Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

    •  Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests (Non-GAAP): The Company has arrangements involving third-
       party noncontrolling interests. As a result, our pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling 
       interests. To provide additional useful information to investors, we present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling 
       interests for our Distribution Solutions segment. We believe such information provides a framework for assessing how our business 
       performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. We calculate adjusted operating profit excluding 
       noncontrolling interests by removing pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from adjusted operating profit (Non-GAAP).  
       Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit excluding 
       noncontrolling interests with the applicable segment’s revenues. This information is supplemental to the Company’s GAAP financial 
       results and is provided in Schedule 3 of this document. 

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We present adjusted operating profit margin excluding 
noncontrolling interests to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of net income that is not 
attributable to McKesson. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered 
a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
