•  First-quarter fiscal 2020 revenues of $55.7 billion, an increase of 6%. 
•  First-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing 
   operations of $2.27, up 429% year over year. 
•  First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.31, up 14% year 
   over year.  
•  Raised fiscal 2020 Adjusted EPS guidance range to $14.00 to $14.60 
   from $13.85 to $14.45.
•  Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 5% to 41 cents 
   per share. 

      IRVING, Texas, July 31, 2019 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2019, were 
$55.7 billion compared to $52.6 billion a year ago, an increase of 6% on a 
reported basis and an increase of 7% on an FX-adjusted basis.  
      On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), 
first-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.27, 
compared to a loss per diluted share of $(0.69) a year ago. 
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.31, an increase 
of 14% compared to $2.90 a year ago, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment and a lower share count, 
partially offset by a higher tax rate. 
       “McKesson is off to a strong start in fiscal 2020, and our first-quarter 
earnings performance exceeded our expectations,” said Brian Tyler, chief 
executive officer. “Based on the momentum from our first-quarter results and our 
confidence in the full year outlook, we are raising our previous guidance range 
for fiscal 2020 and now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $14.00 to 
$14.60.” 
      For the first quarter, McKesson used cash from operations of $51 million, 
and invested $111 million internally, resulting in negative free cash flow of $162 


                                   1 
million. During the quarter, McKesson paid $46 million for acquisitions, and 
returned $759 million of cash to shareholders via $684 million of common stock 
repurchases and $75 million of dividend payments. The Board of Directors also 
approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.41 per share. The 
company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion. 

U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $44.2 billion, up 8%, driven primarily by 
      market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. GAAP 
      operating profit was $579 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.31%. 
      Adjusted operating profit was $600 million, up 11%, and adjusted 
      operating margin was 1.36%.  

European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $6.7 billion, down 3% on a reported basis and 
      up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by market growth in the 
      pharmaceutical distribution business. GAAP operating profit was $5 million 
      and GAAP operating margin was 0.07%. Adjusted operating profit was 
      $35 million, down 53%, and adjusted operating margin was 0.52%. On an 
      FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was $37 million, down 50%, 
      and adjusted operating margin was 0.52%, driven by the weak retail 
      pharmacy environment in the U.K. 

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, up 12%, driven by an acquisition 
      and growth in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses. The 
      aforementioned acquisition closed in the prior fiscal year on June 1, 2018, 
      and has now been fully lapped. GAAP operating profit was $125 million 
      and GAAP operating margin was 6.57%. Adjusted operating profit was 
      $159 million, up 27%, and adjusted operating margin was 8.36%.  


                                   2
Other remaining businesses (primarily including McKesson Canada, 
McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions (MRxTS) and the equity method 
investment in the Change Healthcare Joint Venture (Change Healthcare)) 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $3.0 billion, down 1% on a reported basis and 
      up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by growth in our MRxTS 
      business. GAAP operating profit was $141 million and adjusted operating 
      profit was $276 million, up 30%. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted 
      operating profit was $279 million, up 31%.

Fiscal 2020 Outlook and Change Healthcare Update  
      McKesson raised fiscal 2020 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share 
guidance to $14.00 - $14.60 from a range of $13.85 - $14.45. 
      Following the completion of the Change Healthcare, Inc. IPO, McKesson 
owns approximately 58.5% of Change Healthcare, reduced from 70%. McKesson 
will continue to report the equity income from its interest in Change Healthcare 
based on its revised equity ownership percentage and with a one-month lag.  
            McKesson reaffirmed the guidance range for adjusted equity earnings 
from Change Healthcare of approximately $250 million to $270 million in fiscal 
2020. This range reflects McKesson’s revised equity ownership, and includes the 
expected benefit of lower interest expense for Change Healthcare driven by its 
repayment of long-term debt.

Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-


                                   4
related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and 
asset impairment charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, 
gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment 
charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are 
beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its 
impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 

FX-Adjusted 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-adjusted basis. The 
company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, 
British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the financial 
results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. FX-adjusted information is presented to provide a framework for 
assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental FX-adjusted information 
of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is 
provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 

Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash 
flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for 
property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined 
in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
(b)  We calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share for fiscal 2019 using a weighted average of 202 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted 
     share. We calculate Adjusted Earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for fiscal 2019 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 203 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a 
     fully-diluted basis, any cross-footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts.
(c)  Adjusted Earnings per share on an FX-Adjusted basis for fiscal 2020 was $3.33 per diluted share, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.02 per diluted share.

NM   Computation not meaningful.

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) 
      inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, other adjustments as 
      well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings 
      on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of 
      the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-
      GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and 
      the formation of joint ventures.

      Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs.  
      Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments 
      and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, 
      contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, and gains 
      or losses on business combinations and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring and asset impairment charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we 
      change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
      well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation 
      costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. 
      The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management 
      structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The 
      amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of 
      reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from the Adjusted 
      Earnings. 

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; other asset impairments; certain 
      discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; 
      gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate. Prior to fiscal 
      2020, this category also included certain gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations. 


      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2


                                  SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on 
      an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local 
      currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present 
      Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the 
      Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-
      Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the 
      financial statement tables included with this release.   

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting 
processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital 
and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local 
currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can 
be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our 
business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and 
related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as 
determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
