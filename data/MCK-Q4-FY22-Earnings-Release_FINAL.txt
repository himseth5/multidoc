      "McKesson delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2022," said Brian Tyler, chief executive 
officer. "Our transformation to a diversified healthcare services company is underway and our strategy is 
working.” 
       
      “We are encouraged by the growth in our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services, and 
the strength in our core North American distribution businesses,” Mr. Tyler continued. "Our results reflect the 
unwavering commitment of our employees and their resilience to deliver for our customers, patients, our 
communities, and our shareholders. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us to advance 
healthcare outcomes for all in fiscal 2023 and beyond." 
       
      Fourth-quarter revenues were $66.1 billion, an increase of 12% from a year ago, and full-year 
revenues were $264.0 billion, an increase of 11%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical 
segment, due to increased volumes of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national 
account customers, and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.  
 
      Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.48 compared to $4.15 
a year ago, a decrease of $1.67. Full-year earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $7.26 
compared to a loss per diluted share of ($28.26) a year ago, an increase of $35.52, due to a prior year pre-
tax charge of $8.1 billion expense accrual related to the opioid litigation. 
 
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $5.83 compared to $5.05 a year ago, an 
increase of 15%, driven by growth across the business and a lower share count. Full-year Adjusted 
Earnings per Diluted Share was $23.69 compared to $17.21 a year ago, an increase of 38%, driven by 
strong operating performance across the segments, the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, 
kitting, and storage programs with the U.S. government, and a lower share count. 
 
      For the full-year, McKesson returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.5 billion 
of common stock repurchases and $277 million of dividend payments. During the fiscal year, McKesson 
generated cash from operations of $4.4 billion, and invested $535 million in capital expenditures, resulting in 
Free Cash Flow of $3.9 billion.

   •  Segment Operating Profit was $693 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $780 million, a 
      decrease of 4%, driven by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, partially offset by growth

      Profit growth of 2%.

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   Fourth-Quarter 
   •  Revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of 29%, driven by volume growth related to biopharma

International Segment

      COVID-19 and sales to new customers in the Canadian business. 
   •  Segment Operating Loss was $968 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating

European market. For fiscal 2023, McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share of $22.90 to

impacts attributable to the following: 
   •  $0.05 to $0.25 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage 
      programs; and $0.15 to $0.35 related to COVID-19 tests. 
       
      Fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance excluding the impacts of the above items 
from both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and $0.47 related to net gains associated with 
McKesson Ventures' equity investments in fiscal 2022, indicates 9% to 14% forecasted growth compared to

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted 
Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment 
Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted 
Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in 
accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the 
accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP 
financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
       


                                             
                                                                                        

      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially.

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the year ended March 31, 
     2021 using a weighted average of 160.6 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect 
     when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the year ended March 31, 2021 on a fully 
     diluted basis, using a weighted average of 162.0 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a 
     fully diluted basis, any footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts. This methodology results in a per share 
     difference of $0.24 for the year ended March 31, 2021.
(c)  Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three months and year ended March 31, 2022 was $5.84 and $23.60, respectively,  
     which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.01 and $0.09, respectively.

   inventory  write  downs  to  zero  net  realizable  value,  and  instead  direct  it  to  charitable  organizations  or  otherwise 
   dispose. A portion of this inventory was committed for donation during our first quarter of fiscal 2022, which was 
   delivered during the fiscal year. Due to the nature of this expected in-kind donation of inventory in a quantitatively 
   significant  amount,  management  believes  this  charge  is  not  part  of  normal  business  operations  and  is  therefore 
   excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  A  pre-tax  charge  of  $147  million  ($112  million  after-tax)  is 
   included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which we no longer plan to sell and instead 
   plan to donate or otherwise dispose, and a pre-tax charge of $8 million ($6 million after-tax) is included under "total 
   operating expenses" related to the already committed donation in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating 
   results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  3 of 3


                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(13) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $69 
   million  (pre-tax  and  after-tax)  within  International  related  to  our  European  retail  business,  partially  offset  by  the 
   related  indirect  effect  of  $4  million  benefit  in  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests.  This  impairment 
   charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(14) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 million after-
   tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") within U.S. 
   Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down the law as 
   unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering calendar year 
   2019  sales  and  beyond.  In  September  2020,  an  appellate  court  reversed  on  procedural  grounds  the  district  court’s 
   decision.  An  amendment  to  the  Act  made  clear  that  the  OSA  applies  only  to  NY  opioid  sales  or  distributions  for 
   calendar years 2017 and 2018. On October 4, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court denied further review, and, as a result, we 
   anticipate facing liability under the OSA for calendar years 2017 and 2018. We believe the estimated OSA liability is 
   one-time in nature because the liability is retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 2017 and 2018, and is not 
   indicative of future results. Inclusion of this accrual in our adjusted results would distort current period performance. 
   This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results 
   to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees  to  defend  claims,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  This  also  may  include  charges  or  credits  for  general  non-
   operational claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3


                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
