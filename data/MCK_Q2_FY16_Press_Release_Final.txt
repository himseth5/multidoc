•  Revenues of $48.8 billion for the second quarter, up 10%.  
•  Second-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 
   of $2.65, up 29%.  
•  Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.31, up 19%.  
 •  Consolidated results include a pre-tax gain of $51 million, or 14 cents per 
    diluted share, from the sale of our ZEE Medical business. 
 •  Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. 
 •  Fiscal 2016 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $13.00. 
  
       SAN FRANCISCO, October 29, 2015 – McKesson Corporation 
 (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the second quarter ended 
 September 30, 2015 were $48.8 billion, up 10% compared to $44.2 billion a year 
 ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 14% over the prior year. 
 On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), second-
 quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.65 
 compared to $2.05 a year ago.  
       Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.31, up 19% 
 compared to $2.79 a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted Earnings 
 per diluted share increased 20% over the prior year. Second-quarter results 
 include a pre-tax gain of $51 million, or 14 cents per diluted share, related to the 
 sale of the ZEE Medical business within the Distribution Solutions segment.  
 Second-quarter results also reflect lower than expected tax expense driven by a 
 discrete tax benefit of $25 million, or 11 cents per diluted share.  
       For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from 
 operations of $1.3 billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents 
 of $5.4 billion.  During the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson repurchased 
 nearly $500 million of its common stock, repaid $498 million in long-term debt, 
 had internal capital spending of $274 million and paid $114 million in dividends. 
       At its recent meeting, McKesson’s Board of Directors authorized a new  
 $2 billion share repurchase program.   


                                    1 
       “McKesson delivered solid results during the first six months of our fiscal 
year. In addition to the strong operating performance across our businesses in 
the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares totaling 
nearly $500 million, announced the acquisition of the UK pharmacy operations of 
Sainsbury’s and the acquisition of the pharmaceutical distribution business of 
United Drug Group in Ireland. At its recent meeting, our Board of Directors also 
authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program and we remain 
exceptionally well positioned to continue to execute our portfolio approach to 
capital deployment. We were also privileged to be selected by Albertsons as its 
pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner across all of its U.S. brands.  
I am confident in the strength and scale of our global value proposition for our 
customers and our manufacturing partners, and I am excited about the 
opportunities across our diversified portfolio of businesses,” said John H. 
Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. 
      “We are updating our full-year outlook and now expect Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share of $12.50 to $13.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016,” 
concluded Hammergren.   
 
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $48 billion for the quarter, up 11% on 
a reported basis and up 14% on a constant currency basis.   
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were 
$40.6 billion for the quarter, up 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant 
currency basis. North America revenue growth primarily reflects market growth 
and our mix of business.     
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.9 
billion for the quarter, down 13% on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant 
currency basis.   
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services second-quarter revenues were 
up 3% for the quarter, driven by market growth.   
      In the second quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was 
$926 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.93%. Second-quarter adjusted 


                                   2 
 operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and up 11% on a 
 constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth in our North America 
 pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues and a pre-tax gain of $51 
 million from the sale of the ZEE Medical business. Adjusted operating margin for 
 the Distribution Solutions segment was 2.39%.  
        Technology Solutions second-quarter revenues were $721 million, down 
 6% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the completed sale of our 
 nurse triage business in our first quarter and by the anticipated year-over-year 
 decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other 
 technology businesses.  
       Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $146 million for the 
 second quarter and GAAP operating margin was 20.25%. Adjusted operating 
 profit was $157 million for the second quarter and adjusted operating margin was 
 21.78%.   
        
 Fiscal Year 2016 Outlook 
       McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share between $12.50 
 and $13.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, based on an exchange 
 rate of $1.10 per Euro. The updated full-year outlook reflects a number of items, 
including the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter, the impact of the 
recently completed $500 million share repurchase program, and a reduction in 
our full-year adjusted tax rate from 31.5% to 31%, primarily driven by a favorable 
 discrete tax item recognized in the second quarter. The revised guidance range 
also reflects the expiration of the Optum contract at the start of the third quarter 
 and an assumption that generic pharmaceutical pricing trends will remain weak in 
 the second half of the fiscal year and similar to the level of the second quarter.  
       The updated outlook for Adjusted Earnings per diluted share between 
 $12.50 and $13.00 excludes the following GAAP items: 
   •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.25 per diluted 
      share.  
   •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 33 cents per diluted 
      share. 


                                    3 
    •  LIFO inventory-related charges of 89 cents to 99 cents per diluted share. 
        
       The Fiscal 2016 guidance range does not include any potential claim or 
 litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
 divestitures, and impairments or material restructurings.  
  
 Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
 income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim 
 and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting changes to the company’s reserves 
 for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation 
 matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A 
 reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is 
 provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with 
 this release. 
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a Constant Currency 
 basis.  The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.  As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates.  Constant Currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how its business performed excluding the effect of 
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental Constant 
 Currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                          SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of 
other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

     • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
       acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and 
       Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition of 
       Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and will update the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
       qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted 
       Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

       Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business 
       acquisitions by the Company. 

       Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions by 
       the Company.  Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention 
       payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing 
       expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

       Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable losses 
       for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in the 
       Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.

       LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

       Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
       which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

     • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
       our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
       exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
       estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s non-controlling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
       which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
       Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with 
GAAP.
                                                                     ****
                                      Euro to U.S. Dollar Average Foreign Exchange Rates by Quarter
Our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business reflects the results from Celesio AG ("Celesio"). Celesio independently reports 
its financial results in Euros. Our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2016, as provided on a constant currency 
basis, exclude primarily the effects of the Euro to the U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations between the current periods and the comparable 
periods previously reported.
