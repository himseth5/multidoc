      "McKesson delivered record first-quarter earnings, marking another quarter of solid performance 
across all four operating segments,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “As we execute against our 
strategic priorities, we are evolving our portfolio to drive long-term growth and create shareholder value. We 
remain optimistic that the momentum we’ve generated will continue given the strength we see across our 
businesses. Based on our first-quarter operating performance and current trends, we are raising our 
previous guidance range for fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share to $19.80 to $20.40.” 
 
                         


 
 

      First-quarter revenues were $62.7 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago, driven by growth in 
the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account customers and 
market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
       
      During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, McKesson committed to donate certain personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 recovery efforts. First-quarter earnings 
per diluted share from continuing operations of $3.09 included $164 million of pre-tax inventory charges on 
certain PPE and related products. First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share excluded $155 million of 
these charges for inventory which the company no longer intends to sell and will instead direct to charitable 
organizations. 
       
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $5.56 compared to $2.77 a year ago, an 
increase of 101%, driven by the recovery of prescription volumes and primary care patient visits following 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted Earnings per diluted share growth was also driven by a 
lower tax rate and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs with the U.S. 
government.  
       
      For the first three months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $1.0 billion of common stock repurchases and $69 million of dividend payments. During the 
first three months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $1.6 billion, and invested $159 
million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $1.8 billion. McKesson also used 
$1.0 billion of cash for payments related to the exercises of a put right option available to non-controlling 
shareholders of McKesson Europe that expired in June 2021. 
 
Business Highlights 
   •  McKesson is playing a central role in the COVID-19 response efforts in the U.S. and abroad through 
      the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, ancillary supply kits, and COVID-19 tests.  
   •  McKesson’s partnership with the U.S. government was expanded to support the U.S. government’s 
      international COVID-19 vaccine donation mission. Including vaccine distribution in the U.S. and 
      related to the U.S. government’s international donation mission, McKesson has successfully shipped 
      over 250 million COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of the U.S. government through July 31, 2021. 
   •  On July 7, 2021, McKesson announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its European 
      businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the PHOENIX group for 
      approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. The transaction is 
      subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and is expected to close in 
      fiscal 2023. McKesson is committed to exploring strategic alternatives for all remaining European 
      businesses. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $50.0 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by higher volumes from retail 
      national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.  
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $682 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $682 million, an increase of 16%, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and 
      growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. 

      
 

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34%, driven by higher volumes of 
      technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers and the recovery of prescription 
      volumes. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $104 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $139 million, an increase of 62%, driven by organic growth from access and adherence solutions 
      and the recovery of prescription volumes.  
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, an increase of 40%, driven by improvements in primary 
      care patient visits and increased sales of COVID-19 tests. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $75 million and included $164 million of pre-tax 
      inventory charges on certain PPE and related products. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, 
      McKesson committed to donate certain PPE to charitable organizations to assist in COVID-19 
      recovery efforts. First-quarter Adjusted Segment Operating Profit excluded $155 million of these 
      charges for inventory which the company no longer intends to sell and will instead direct to 
      charitable organizations. 
   •  Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $257 million, an increase of 107%, driven by improvements 
      in primary care patient visits and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for 
      the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. 
 
International Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $9.2 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $8.3 billion, a 
      decline of 3%, driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint 
      venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, 
      partially offset by volume recovery in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy 
      businesses. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $53 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $151 million, an increase of 107%, driven by volume recovery in the 
      pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy businesses and distribution of COVID-19 tests and 
      vaccines. 
 
Company Updates  
   •  On July 21, 2021, McKesson announced that it negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement 
      agreement which, if all conditions are satisfied, would result in the settlement of a substantial 
      majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. 
   •  McKesson's Board of Directors declared an increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.47 per 
      share of common stock, demonstrating McKesson's commitment to returning cash to shareholders 
      and confidence in its outlook. 
   •  For the sixth consecutive year, McKesson was named a "Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion." 
      McKesson earned a top-ranking score of 100 on the 2021 Disability Equality Index®, a joint initiative 
      of the American Association of People with Disabilities and Disabilities:IN. 
                         

      
 

Fiscal 2022 Outlook 
      McKesson raised fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance to $19.80 to $20.40 from 
the previous range of $18.85 to $19.45 to reflect strong first-quarter operating performance and increased 
contribution from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting programs. Fiscal 2022 
Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance assumes $0.45 to $0.55 related to U.S. government COVID-
19 vaccine distribution and does not assume any contribution from COVID-19 vaccines designated for 
pediatric patients or booster shots. Guidance also assumes $0.35 to $0.45 related to the kitting and 
distribution of ancillary supplies. Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call 
presentation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, 
Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating 
Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash 
Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental 
Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions 
and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for 
reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly 
comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially. 


      
 

Cautionary Statements  
      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the

in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and 
changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession 
and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access to credit, increase our 
borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely 
impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events 
outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced 
from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; we may be

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months ended June 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges 
   of  $158  million  ($129  million  after-tax),  primarily  for  Corporate  expenses,  net  as  well  as  our  Canada  and  Europe 
   businesses. The three months ended June 30, 2020 includes charges of $56 million ($44 million after-tax), primarily 
   for  Corporate  expenses,  net  as  well  as  our  Europe  and  Canada  businesses.  Our  Europe  and  Canada  businesses  are 
   included  within  International.  These  charges  are  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables. Additionally, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months ended 
   June 30, 2020 includes immaterial amounts under “gross profit” in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating 
   results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. 

(2) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three months ended June 30, 2020 includes a pre-tax net gain of $131 million 
   ($97 million after-tax) related to insurance proceeds received, net of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to plaintiffs' 
   counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our controlled 
   substances monitoring program within Corporate expenses, net. This gain is included under "total operating expenses" 
   in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 
   of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(3) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three months ended June 30, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $27 million 
   ($22  million  after-tax)  related  to  an  agreement  to  settle  opioid-related  claims  with  the  State  of  New  York  and  its 
   participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million 
   after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of 
   participating states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These 
   charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(4) Other  adjustments,  net  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2021  includes  pre-tax  charges  of  $155  million  ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical  Solutions.  These  charges  are  driven  by  the  intent  of  management  to  not  sell  this  excess  inventory  which 
   required inventory write downs to zero net realizable value, and instead direct it to charitable organizations. A portion 
   of this inventory has already been committed for donation during our first quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of 
   this expected in-kind donation of inventory in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is 
   not part of normal business operations and is therefore excluded from our determination of adjusted results. A pre-tax 
   charge  of  $147  million  ($112  million  after-tax)  is  included  under  "gross  profit"  primarily  related  to  the  excess 
   inventory, which we no longer plan to sell and instead plan to donate, and a pre-tax charge of $8 million ($6 million 
   after-tax) is included under "total operating expenses" related to the already committed donation in the reconciliation 
   of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                       SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by

following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•  Adjusted Gross Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Gross Profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding transaction-
   related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal 
   settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments.

•  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
