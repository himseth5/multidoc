•  Revenues of $56.2 billion for the third quarter, up 5% year over year. 
•  Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of 
   $2.41. 
•  Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.40, flat year over 
   year. 
•  Fiscal 2019 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $13.45 to $13.65 per diluted share. 
 
      SAN FRANCISCO, January 31, 2019 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 
31, 2018, were $56.2 billion, up 5% compared to $53.6 billion a year ago, and 
also up 5% on a constant currency basis. On the basis of U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter earnings per diluted share 
from continuing operations was $2.41, compared to earnings per diluted share of 
$4.32 a year ago. Prior year GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net tax 
benefit of approximately $1.78 per diluted share driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act of 2017. 
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.40, flat 
compared to $3.41 a year ago, primarily driven by a lower share count and 
growth in our Medical-Surgical business, offset by a higher tax rate and lower 
profit contribution from our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, which includes a $60 
million, or approximately $0.23 cents per diluted share, charge related to a 
customer bankruptcy and previously announced customer losses. 
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash 
from operations of $141 million, and invested $405 million internally, resulting in 
negative free cash flow of $264 million, which was in line with the company’s 
expectations. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid 
$866 million for acquisitions, repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of its 
common stock, paid $216 million in dividends and the company ended the 
quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. 


                                   1 
       
      “Our third-quarter results reflect solid adjusted operating profit 
performance, particularly in our Medical-Surgical and McKesson Prescription 
Technology Solutions businesses, and we are pleased with the progress we are 
seeing in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Canadian businesses as we work to 
offset headwinds we discussed when providing our fiscal year outlook in May,” 
said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson 
Corporation. “Our year-to-date results provide momentum heading into our fiscal 
fourth quarter, positioning the company well as Brian Tyler assumes the role of 
chief executive officer on April 1, 2019.” 
       
Segment Results 
      U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues were $44.3 billion 
for the quarter, up 6%, driven primarily by market growth and acquisitions, 
partially offset by previously announced customer losses and branded to generic 
conversions. Segment GAAP operating profit was $671 million and GAAP 
operating margin was 1.52%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $593 million 
and adjusted operating margin was 1.34%.  
      European Pharmaceutical Solutions revenues were $6.9 billion for the 
quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant currency basis, 
driven primarily by market growth, partially offset by the previously disclosed 
reduction in owned retail pharmacies and a challenging operating environment in 
the U.K. Segment GAAP operating profit was $26 million and GAAP operating 
margin was 0.38%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $69 million and 
adjusted operating margin was 1.00%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted 
operating profit was $71 million and adjusted operating margin was 0.99%. 
      Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $2.0 billion for the quarter, up 
19%, driven primarily by an acquisition and market growth. Segment GAAP 
operating profit was $136 million and GAAP operating margin was 6.76%. 
Segment adjusted operating profit was $170 million and adjusted operating 
margin was 8.45%. 


                                   2 
      Revenues included in Other were $3.0 billion for the quarter, up 1% on a 
reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by 
market growth. Other GAAP operating profit was $74 million and adjusted 
operating profit was $224 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted 
operating profit was $226 million. 
       
Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook  
      McKesson now expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.45 to 
$13.65 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, from the previous range of 
$13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share.  
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis 
as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-
looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking 
GAAP measure without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently uncertain 
and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control.

of thirty-nine cents per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable on

Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-
related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and 
asset impairment charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, 
gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment 
charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are 
beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its 
impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
       
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 


                                   4 
Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release. 
       
Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash 
flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less property 
acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the company’s 
condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

compliance or funding challenges; public health issues in the U.S. or abroad; 
cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction of sophisticated internal computer 
systems to perform as designed; the adequacy of insurance to cover property 
loss or liability claims; the company’s proprietary products and services may not 
be adequately protected, and its products and solutions may be found to infringe 
on the rights of others; system errors or failure of our technology products or 
services to conform to specifications; disaster or other event causing interruption 
of customer access to data residing in our service centers; changes in 
circumstances that could impair our goodwill or intangible assets; new or revised 
tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions; general economic conditions, 
including changes in the financial markets that may affect the availability and cost 
of credit to the company, its customers or suppliers; changes in accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; withdrawal from 
participation in multiemployer pension plans or if such plans are reported to have 
underfunded liabilities; inability to realize the expected benefits from the 
company’s restructuring and business process initiatives; difficulties with 
outsourcing and similar third party relationships; risks associated with the 
company’s retail expansion; and the company’s inability to keep existing retail 
store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places. The reader

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition and transaction related expenses and adjustments, Last-In, First-Out 
      (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, other 
      adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.
      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures, and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs.  Examples include 
      transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee 
      relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent 
      consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses 
      related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the 
      Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.
      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring and asset impairment charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we 
      change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
      well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation 
      costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. 
      The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management 
      structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The 
      amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of 
      reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from the Adjusted 
      Earnings. 

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; other asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; certain 
      discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; 
      gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2


                                SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures 
disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated 
in accordance with GAAP.
