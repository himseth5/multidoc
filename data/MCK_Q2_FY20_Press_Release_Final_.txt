2Represents a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures included in accompanying schedules 
                                                                                               

       “McKesson’s second-quarter results reflect continued momentum across the business as well 
as further progress against our cost savings initiatives,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “As 
we look forward to the second half of our fiscal year, we remain confident in the strength of our broad 
set of solutions and capabilities, delivering execution against our strategic imperatives as we become 
a more focused and efficient organization.” 
      Revenues increased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical 
and Specialty Solutions segment, largely due to branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher 
volumes from a retail national account customer.   
      Loss per diluted share of $(3.99) included charges of approximately $1.4 billion, or $5.73 per 
diluted share, primarily related to an impairment in connection with McKesson’s planned exit of its 
investment in Change Healthcare. Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.60 was flat year-over-
year, as a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical and McKesson Prescription 
Technology Solutions (MRxTS) businesses were offset primarily by the lapping of a prior year pre-tax 
benefit of $90 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, related to a reversal of a contractual liability 
associated with McKesson’s investment in Change Healthcare. Excluding the prior year benefit of 
$0.33 per diluted share from Adjusted Earnings, second-quarter results per diluted share increased 
10%. 


                                            1 
      During the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders 
via $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $148 million of dividend payments. For the first half 
of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $159 million, and invested $184 million 
internally, resulting in negative free cash flow of $343 million.  
       
U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $46.0 billion, up 10%, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical price 
      increases and increased specialty pharmaceutical volume from the company’s largest retail 
      national account customer, partially offset by branded to generic conversions.  
   •  Operating profit was $639 million and operating margin was 1.39%. Adjusted operating profit 
      was $641 million, up 1%, due to continued growth in the specialty businesses, partially offset 
      by customer and product mix. Adjusted operating margin was 1.39%, down 14 basis points, 
      primarily resulting from the higher volume of specialty pharmaceuticals. 
 
European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1% on a reported basis and up 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, 
      driven primarily by growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business.  
   •  Operating profit was $1 million and operating margin was 0.02%. Adjusted operating profit was 
      $41 million, down 23%, and adjusted operating margin was 0.62%. On an FX-adjusted basis, 
      adjusted operating profit was $43 million, down 19%, and adjusted operating margin was 
      0.62%, down 18 basis points, driven by the challenging retail pharmacy environment in the 
      U.K. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6%, driven primarily by growth in the Primary Care business, 
      largely due to the increase in volume of pharmaceutical products.  
   •  Operating profit was $129 million and operating margin was 6.27%. Adjusted operating profit 
      was $166 million, up 20%, and adjusted operating margin was 8.07%, up 99 basis points. The 
      year-over-year growth primarily reflects growth in the Primary Care business and the lapping of 
      bad debt expense in the prior year.  
 
Other remaining businesses  
   •  Revenues were $3.0 billion, up 4% on a reported basis and up 5% on an FX-adjusted basis, 
      driven by growth in the Canadian and MRxTS businesses.  
   •  Operating loss was $(1.3) billion driven by charges of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily 
      related to an impairment in connection with McKesson’s planned exit of its investment in 
      Change Healthcare. Adjusted operating profit was $221 million, down 26% on both a reported 
      and FX-adjusted basis, primarily due to the lapping of the $90 million contractual liability 
      reversal in the prior year and lower contribution from the company’s investment in Change 
      Healthcare, partially offset by higher volumes in the MRxTS business.

Company Updates 
   •  On October 21, 2019, the company announced an agreement in principle to settle all claims 
      against the company in the first track of the multi-district opioid litigation, related to two Ohio 
      counties. As a result, McKesson recorded a pre-tax charge of $82 million within operating 
      expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. 
   •  McKesson recently published its FY19 Corporate Responsibility Report, describing how the 
      company continues to work to use its economic, environmental, social and governance 
      resources thoughtfully and responsibly. This global report puts emphasis on three topics: 
      product quality and patient safety; eco-efficient transportation and operations; and better health 
      for employees and communities. 
   •  McKesson opened a new distribution center in the Seattle area, an eco-friendly facility 
      featuring the latest in supply chain technology and state-of-the-art automation.  
   •  Maria Martinez joined McKesson’s Board of Directors as a new independent director effective 
      October 18, 2019. 
 
Fiscal 2020 Outlook  
   •  McKesson reaffirmed fiscal 2020 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance range of 
      $14.00 - $14.60.

Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted 
Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, 
excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction-related expenses and 
adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 

                                            3
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for 
each of these items, as applicable. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted 
Earnings is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis prospectively as 
McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP 
measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable 
effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from 
antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, 
which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on 
various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated 
estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
       
FX-Adjusted 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-adjusted basis. The company conducts 
business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a 
result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. FX-adjusted information is presented to provide a framework for 
assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange 
rate fluctuations. The supplemental FX-adjusted information of the company’s GAAP financial results 
and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release. 
       
Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as 
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment 
and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the company’s condensed consolidated 
statements of cash flows.  
       
Cautionary Statements 
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may 
constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to 
identify all such risks and uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required

or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, 
strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We 
encourage investors to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 

                                            4
10-Q and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risk factors 
include, but are not limited to: changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environment; 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of the Change Healthcare joint venture on 
the company’s results of operations; the company’s ability to manage and complete divestitures and 
distributions; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings, including those related to the 
distribution of controlled substances; cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction of sophisticated 
internal computer systems to perform as designed; and the potential inadequacy of insurance to

(a)   Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
(b)   We calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 using a weighted average of 183 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net 
      loss per diluted share. We calculate Adjusted Earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 184 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per 
      share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any cross-footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts.
(c)   Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $3.60.

(a)   Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
(b)   We calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share for fiscal 2020 using a weighted average of 185 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We 
      calculate Adjusted Earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for fiscal 2020 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 186 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any 
      cross-footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts.
(c)   Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis for fiscal 2020 was $6.92, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.01.

                                        SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  Moreover, 
the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other 
companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently 
by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-
      related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, other adjustments as well as the 
      related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic 
      basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s 
      presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
      Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and the 
      formation of joint ventures.

      Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs.  Examples 
      include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation 
      expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and 
      inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, and gains or losses on business 
      combinations and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring, impairment and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, 
      the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset 
      impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract 
      termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs 
      may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount 
      rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The 
      amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment 
      in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from Adjusted Earnings. 

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may 
      include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; other asset impairments; certain discrete 
      benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses 
      from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate. Prior to fiscal 2020, this category 
      also included certain gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations. 

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted items, 
      except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted earnings per diluted share. 
                                                                                                                                  2 of 2


                                  SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-
      Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. 
      dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per 
      diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling 
      interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
      Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included 
      with this release.   

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. 
Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing 
business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including 
Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding 
the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by 
the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
