      SAN FRANCISCO, July 29, 2015 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015 were 
$47.5 billion, up 9% compared to $43.5 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), first-quarter earnings per 
diluted share from continuing operations was $2.50 compared to $1.76 a year 
ago.  
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.14, up 27% 
compared to $2.47 a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share increased 30% over the prior year. First-quarter results include 
a pre-tax gain of $51 million, or 16 cents per diluted share, related to the sale of 
the nurse triage business within Technology Solutions.  
       “McKesson’s first quarter results represent a good start to the fiscal year 
driven by solid execution across both segments,” said John H. Hammergren, 
chairman and chief executive officer. “We are updating our outlook to reflect the 
gain on the sale of our nurse triage business, and now expect Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share of $12.36 to $12.86 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.”  
      For the first quarter, McKesson generated cash from operations of $454 
million, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 billion. 
During the quarter, McKesson paid $59 million in dividends and had internal 
capital spending of $120 million.  


                                   1 
      Earlier today, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly 
dividend from 24 cents to 28 cents per share. In addition, Celesio announced 
plans to acquire Sainsbury’s UK-based pharmacy operations.  
      “We are pleased with the dividend increase and are excited about the 
planned acquisition of Sainsbury’s pharmacies. The acquisition will add 281 new 
pharmacies to the Lloyd’s Pharmacy brand in the United Kingdom and 
complements the more than 12,000 owned or banner pharmacies across 
McKesson,” said Hammergren. “We have a strong track record of creating value 
for our shareholders with our portfolio approach to capital deployment through a 
mixture of internal investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. 
The acquisition of Sainsbury’s pharmacies and dividend increase further 
demonstrate our commitment to this approach and our commitment to long-term 
shareholder value creation,” Hammergren concluded. 
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $46.8 billion for the quarter, up 10% 
on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for the 
quarter were up 15% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis, 
primarily reflecting market growth and our mix of business.  
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.8 
billion for the quarter, down 17% on a reported basis and flat on a constant 
currency basis.  
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up 4% for the 
quarter, driven by market growth.  
      In the first quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $910 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.94%. First-quarter adjusted operating 
profit was $1.1 billion, up 14% from the prior year, driven by solid performance 
across the segment. Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions 
segment was 2.42%.  


                                   2 
      Technology Solutions revenues were down 4% in the first quarter primarily 
driven by an anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, 
partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.  
      GAAP operating profit was $158 million for the first quarter and GAAP 
operating margin was 21.47%. Adjusted operating profit was $167 million for the 
first quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.69%. Technology Solutions 
first quarter results reflect a pre-tax gain of $51 million, or 16 cents per diluted 
share, related to the sale of the nurse triage business.  
 
Fiscal Year 2016 Outlook 
      McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share between $12.36 
and $12.86 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, based on an exchange 
rate of $1.10 per Euro, which excludes the following GAAP items: 
   •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.24 per diluted 
      share.  
   •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 30 cents per diluted 
      share. 
   •  LIFO inventory-related charges of 86 cents to 96 cents per diluted share. 
       
      The Fiscal 2016 guidance range does not include any potential claim or 
litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
divestitures, and impairments or material restructurings.  
 
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim 
and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting changes to the company’s reserves 
for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation 
matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A 
reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is

   cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.
(2) Technology Solutions segment results for fiscal year 2015 reflect a non-cash pre-tax charge of $34 million primarily 
   relating to depreciation and amortization expense due to the reclassification of the workforce business within our

   recorded in cost of sales.
(3) Fiscal year 2016 reflects a pre-tax gain of $51 million ($38 million after-tax) recognized upon the sale of our nurse triage 
   business within our Technology Solutions segment.
(4) Fiscal year 2016 primarily reflects the recurring compensation that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling 
   interests of McKesson's subsidiary, Celesio AG ("Celesio"), under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement 
   (the "Domination Agreement").

(1) Distribution Solutions segment results for fiscal year 2016 reflect $59 million of cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.
(2) Fiscal year 2016 includes a pre-tax gain of $51 million ($38 million after-tax) recognized upon the sale of our nurse triage business within our Technology Solutions segment.
(3) Primarily reflects the recurring compensation that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling interests of McKesson's subsidiary, Celesio, under the Domination Agreement.
(4)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(5)  Technology Solutions segment results for fiscal year 2015 reflect a non-cash pre-tax charge of $34 million primarily relating to depreciation and amortization expense due to the reclassification of 
    the workforce business within our International Technology business from discontinued operations to continuing operations. The charge was primarily recorded in cost of sales.

   McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a Non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain
claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s financial results
determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

                                   Definitions related to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) Financial Information

Adjusted Earnings represents income from continuing operations, excluding the effects of the following items from the Company’s GAAP financial results,
including the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and will update the definition from
time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.
    Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business acquisitions
    by the Company.
    Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions by the Company.
    Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation
    expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses
    related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.
    Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable losses for its
    Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in the Company’s Annual
    Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
    LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.
Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same
accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.
The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted Earnings provides useful supplemental information to investors with
regard to its core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted Earnings assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other
companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Adjusted Earnings measure may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the
same industry.
The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted Earnings in connection with its own financial planning and reporting
processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing
business performance and employee incentive compensation. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company
should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
