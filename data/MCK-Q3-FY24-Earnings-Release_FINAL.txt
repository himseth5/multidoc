      “McKesson delivered another quarter of solid results, led by growth across our North American 
businesses. These results are reflective of the commitment to our company priorities and growth strategies, 
delivering differentiated solutions and value in oncology and biopharma services. I’m proud of our performance 
and ability to continually create value for all stakeholders,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “I want to 
thank our dedicated team members, who continue to execute against our strategy and advance health 
outcomes for all.” 
       
      “As a result of our third quarter performance and solid operating momentum, we are raising and 
narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share to $27.25 to $27.65.” 
       
      Third quarter revenues were $80.9 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago. Revenue increases 
were primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription 
volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 
medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of divestitures within 
McKesson's European business. 
       
      Third quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $4.42 compared to $7.65 a 
year ago, a decrease of $3.23, due to a pre-tax increase to the provision for bad debts of $515 million within 
the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment related to the Rite Aid bankruptcy and a prior year pre-tax benefit of $126 
million associated with the termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare.

      Third quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $7.74 compared to $6.90 a year ago, an 
increase of 12%, driven by a lower tax rate and share count and growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and 
Prescription Technology Solutions segments, partially offset by higher corporate expenses due to a prior year 
pre-tax benefit of $126 million associated with the termination of the tax agreement with Change Healthcare. 
Third quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share also included pre-tax losses of approximately $8 million 
associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.  
 
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $2.3 billion of common stock repurchases and $232 million of dividend payments. During the 
first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $167 million, and invested 
$418 million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $251 million.

   •  Segment Operating Profit was $126 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $104 million, a decrease of 27%, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European

Fiscal 2024 Outlook 
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the Company is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort. McKesson cannot reasonably forecast LIFO 
inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and 
related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are generally 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, and as such, any 
associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.  
 
      McKesson is raising fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $27.25 to $27.65 
from the previous range of $26.80 to $27.40 to reflect solid operating performance, which reflects a growth rate 
of 5% to 7%. 
 
      Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes approximately ($0.15) related to 
year-to-date losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.  
 
      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

                                     FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 includes pre-tax 
     gains  of  $2  million  (pre-tax  and  after-tax)  and  $78  million  ($58  million  after-tax),  respectively,  related  to  fair  value 
     remeasurements of the contingent consideration liability recognized as part of our acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, 
     LLC. The gains, within Prescription Technology Solutions, resulted from remeasurement of the liability to fair value at 
     the  end  of  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  estimated  amount  and  timing  of  projected  operational  and  financial 
     information and the probability of achievement of performance milestones. These pre-tax gains are included under "total 
     operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
     provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(2)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 includes pre-tax 
     net  gains  of  $31  million  ($36  million  after-tax)  and  $66  million  ($35  million  after-tax),  respectively,  related  to  an 
     agreement to sell certain of our European businesses to the PHOENIX Group which closed on October 31, 2022. Pre-tax 
     gains for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $34 million ($39 million after-tax) and $306 million 
     ($275 million after-tax), respectively, are included within Corporate expenses, net, and charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of 
     $3 million and $240 million, respectively, are included within International. These pre-tax gains and charges are primarily 
     to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell, including the effect of accumulated other 
     comprehensive income balances associated with the disposal group, and are included under "total operating expenses" in 
     the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
     accompanying financial statement tables.

(3)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 includes a pre-tax gain of 
     $142 million ($105 million after-tax) related to the exit of an investment in equity securities within U.S. Pharmaceutical. 
     This gain is included under "other income, net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted 
     results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(4)  Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 includes pre-
     tax  charges  of  $4  million  ($3  million  after-tax)  and  $84  million  ($63  million  after-tax),  respectively,  primarily  for 
     Corporate expenses, net. The three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 includes pre-tax charges of $31 million 
     ($24 million after-tax) and $84 million ($65 million after-tax), respectively, primarily within International and Corporate 
     expenses, net. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
     operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(5)  Other adjustments, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 includes pre-tax provisions for bad debts 
     of  $515  million  ($381  million  after-tax)  and  $725  million  ($536  million  after-tax),  respectively,  within  U.S. 
     Pharmaceutical  related  to  the  bankruptcy  of  our  customer,  Rite  Aid  Corporation  (including  certain  of  its  subsidiaries, 
     “Rite Aid”). Management believes this charge is not reflective of allowances recorded in the normal course of operations 
     and is related to Rite Aid's bankruptcy reorganization, and therefore is excluded from the determination of our adjusted 
     results (Non-GAAP). These charges represent the remaining trade accounts receivable balances due from Rite Aid prior to 
     its bankruptcy petition filing and are included under “total operating expenses” in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
     operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(6)  Other adjustments, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 includes a pre-tax gain of $97 million 
     ($72 million after-tax) within Corporate expenses, net from termination of fixed interest rate swaps accounted for as cash 
     flow hedges. Management believes that this gain is not part of normal business operations and is therefore excluded from 
     our determination of adjusted results. This gain is included under "other income, net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's 
     GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement 
     tables.

(7)  Termination  of  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  ("TRA")  with  Change  Healthcare  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended 
     December  31,  2022  consists  of  a  pre-tax  gain  of  $126  million  ($93  million  after-tax)  within  Corporate  expenses,  net, 
     related to a cash payment received as a result of an exercise of the option by Change Healthcare Inc. ("Change") pursuant 
     to the TRA for early termination of the agreement. We entered into this agreement as part of the formation of a joint 
     venture with Change, from which McKesson has since exited. This amount was recorded in “Other income, net” in the 
     Condensed  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  (GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  1  of  the  accompanying  financial 
     statement tables.
                                                                                                      1 of 1

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In  an  effort  to  provide  investors  with  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's  financial  results  as  determined  by 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP"),  McKesson  Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "we")  also  presents  the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•   Adjusted  Gross  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Gross  Profit  as  GAAP  gross  profit,  excluding  transaction-
    related  expenses  and  adjustments,  last-in,  first-out  (“LIFO”)  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal 
    settlements, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating 
    expenses,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Other  Income  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Other  Income  as  GAAP  other  income  (expense),  net, 
    excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  and  other

•   Adjusted  Interest  Expense  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Interest  Expense  as  GAAP  interest  expense,  excluding 
    transaction-related expenses and adjustments related to net interest expense incurred from cross-currency swaps used to 
    hedge  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  notes  resulting  from  changes  in 
    benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency-denominated notes were previously 
    designated  as  non-derivative  net  investment  hedges  of  portions  of  the  Company's  net  investments  in  its  now-divested 
    European businesses against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the 
    U.S. dollar.

•   Adjusted Income Tax Expense (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Income Tax Expense as GAAP income tax benefit 
    (expense), excluding the income tax effects of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses 
    and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and 
    related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. Income tax effects are calculated in accordance with 
    Accounting  Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  740,  “Income  Taxes,”  which  is  the  same  accounting  principle  used  by  the 
    Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

•   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable 
    to  McKesson,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, 
    claims  and  litigation  charges,  other  adjustments,  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as 
    applicable. 

•   Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share as GAAP earnings 
    per  diluted  common  share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  McKesson,  excluding  per  share  impacts  of 
    amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related 
    adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and  litigation 
    charges,  other  adjustments,  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as  applicable,  divided  by 
    diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

•   Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP)  and  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  (Non-GAAP):

    related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust 
    legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  and  other  adjustments.  We  define  Adjusted  Segment 
    Operating Profit Margin as Adjusted Segment Operating Profit (Non-GAAP) divided by GAAP segment revenues.

•   Adjusted Corporate Expenses (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Corporate Expenses as GAAP corporate expenses, net, 
    excluding  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and

                                                                                                      2 of 2
                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   Adjusted  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Profit  as  GAAP  income  from  continuing 
    operations before interest expense and income taxes, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-
    related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 
    impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. 

    The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-
    GAAP measures as defined above:

    Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  -  Amortization  charges  for  intangible  assets  directly  related  to  business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  -  Transaction,  integration,  and  other  expenses  that  are  directly  related  to 
    business  combinations,  the  formation  of  joint  ventures,  divestitures,  and  other  transaction-related  costs  including  initial 
    public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, 
    retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments 
    including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-related  expenses  or  post-
    closing expenses, net interest expense impact of hedging foreign currency-denominated notes, bridge loan fees and gains or 
    losses on business combinations, and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash charges or credit adjustments.

    Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust legal settlements.

    Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change 
    our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted 
    as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure 
    or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, 
    and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product 
    line,  reorganization  or  management  structure  changes,  headcount  rationalization,  realignment  of  operations  or  products, 
    integration  of  acquired  businesses,  and/or  company-wide  cost  saving  initiatives.  The  amount  and/or  frequency  of  these 
    restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
    Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

    Claims  and  litigation  charges  -  Adjustments  to  certain  of  the  Company’s  reserves,  including  those  related  to  estimated 
    probable  settlements  for  its  controlled  substance  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  opioid-related  claims,  as  well  as  any 
    applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees 
    to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred. This also may include charges or credits for general non-operational 
    claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on 
    an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-
    inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other 
    similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

    The  Company  evaluates  the  aforementioned  Non-GAAP  measures  on  a  periodic  basis  and  updates  the  definitions  from 
    time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-
    GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided 
    in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an 
    FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our 
    operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
    currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-
    Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and 
    adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
    Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
    tables included with this release.
                                                                                                      3 of 3
                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   Free  Cash  Flow  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  (used  in)  operating  activities  less 
    payments  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
    consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-
    GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with 
regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s 
future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability 
to  compare  its  financial  results  to  those  of  other  companies  in  the  same  industry.  However,  the  Company's  Non-GAAP 
measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well 
as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pound sterling. As a result, the comparability 
of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information  to  provide  a  framework  for  assessing  how  our  business  performed  excluding  the  estimated  effect  of  foreign 
currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  useful  to  investors  as  a 
supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic 
acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP adjusted results 
and related Non-GAAP measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial 
results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
