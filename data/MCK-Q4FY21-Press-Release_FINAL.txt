      “Our notable performance in fiscal 2021 reflects the continued momentum in our businesses and is a 
testament to the leadership role McKesson plays in the healthcare supply chain. McKesson’s differentiated 
capabilities make us the partner of choice for our customers and government entities in their COVID-19 
response efforts. I am proud of our employees and what we have accomplished together,” said Brian Tyler, 
chief executive officer. “Despite the dynamic macro environment, the business demonstrated strong 
execution as we grew Adjusted Earnings per diluted share by 15%. These results allowed us to generate 
$3.9 billion of Free Cash Flow.” 

 
 
      “As we enter fiscal 2022, our top priorities remain the safety of our employees, the success of our 
customers, and fulfilling our leadership responsibility as the centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines 
and ancillary supplies in the U.S.,” Mr. Tyler continued. “We have positioned the business for long-term 
growth through strategic investments in the areas of oncology and biopharma services and successful 
transformation of our operating model. Our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 are the foundation for the future 
and we remain confident in our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.”    
       
      Fourth-quarter revenues were $59.1 billion, up 1% from a year ago, driven by market growth and 
higher volumes from retail national account customers in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset 
by the prior year acceleration in demand driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Full-year revenues 
were $238.2 billion, up 3% from a year ago, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely 
due to market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
       
      Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $4.15 compared to $5.82 
a year ago, a decrease of 29%. Full-year loss per diluted share from continuing operations of ($28.26) 
included a pre-tax $8.1 billion expense accrual related to the estimated liability for opioid-related claims. 
This charge was taken in the company’s third-quarter and is not included in full-year Adjusted Earnings per 
diluted share. 
        
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $5.05 compared to $4.27 a year ago, an 
increase of 18%, primarily driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and kitting 
programs with the U.S. government and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate and the 
prior year contribution from the company's now separated investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change 
Healthcare"). Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share included pre-tax net gains of 
approximately $44 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity 
investments.  
       
      Full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $17.21 compared to $14.95 a year ago, an 
increase of 15%, primarily driven by a lower share count and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine 
distribution and kitting programs with the U.S. government, partially offset by the prior year contribution from 
the company's now separated investment in Change Healthcare. Full-year Adjusted Earnings per diluted 
share included pre-tax net gains of approximately $133 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, associated with 
McKesson Ventures' equity investments.  
       
      For the full year, McKesson returned $1.0 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $770 
million of common stock repurchases and $276 million of dividend payments. During the fiscal year, 
McKesson generated cash from operations of $4.5 billion, and invested $641 million in capital expenditures, 
resulting in Free Cash Flow of $3.9 billion.

which reflects Adjusted Operating Profit growth in all segments coupled with disciplined, efficient capital 
deployment, including approximately $2 billion of share repurchases. Fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per 
diluted share guidance assumes $0.40 to $0.50 related to U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution 
and $0.10 to $0.20 related to the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare, 
Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment 
Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted 
Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in 
accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the 
accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP 
financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s 
control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements 
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute 
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial 
performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by 
law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, 
“will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words or 
other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions 
may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors to read the important risk factors 
described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
 
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 
and settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation 

 
 
or challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to 
goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might 
experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience significant 
problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we 
might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our 
contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by 
changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare 
reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes 
or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing 
products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might 
be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely 
impacted by an economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 
pandemic) or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access credit, 
increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might 
be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted 
by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have 
experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic 
events; we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses 
to such change; and we face uncertainties and risks related to vaccination distribution and related ancillary 
supply kit programs.

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the year ended March 31, 
     2021 using a weighted average of 160.6 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effect 
     when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the year ended March 31, 2021 on a fully 
     diluted basis, using a weighted average of 162.0 million common shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a 
     fully  diluted  basis,  any  footing  differences  in  those  items  are  due  to  different  weighted  average  share  counts.  This  methodology  results  in  per  share 
     difference of $0.24 for the year ended March 31, 2021.
(c)  Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three months and year ended March 31, 2021 was $5.01 and $17.15, respectively, 
     which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.04 and $0.06, respectively.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1) Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  includes  our  proportionate  share  of  loss  from  investment  in  Change 
   Healthcare Joint Venture within Other. Such amount includes the amortization of equity investment intangibles and 
   other acquired intangibles of $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and $267 million for the year 
   ended March 31, 2020. These charges are included under "equity earnings and charges from investment in Change 
   Healthcare  Joint  Venture"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-
   GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(2) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the year ended March 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $246 
   million ($184 million after-tax) within Other, representing the difference between our proportionate share of the IPO 
   proceeds and the dilution effect on our investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture carrying value. This charge is 
   included  under  "equity  earnings  and  charges  from  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture"  in  the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables. 

(3) Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  for  the  three  months  and  year  ended  March  31,  2020  includes  an 
   estimated gain of $414 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within Other recognized upon the separation of our investment in 
   Change  Healthcare  LLC  ("Change  Healthcare").  The  separation  was  completed  on  March  10,  2020  and  involved  a 
   series  of  transactions,  including  an  exchange  offer  to  split-off  our  wholly-owned  subsidiary  PF2  SpinCo,  Inc. 
   ("SpinCo") which held all of McKesson's interest in Change Healthcare and a merger of SpinCo with and into Change 
   Healthcare, Inc. ("Change"). McKesson no longer holds an interest in any securities of Change Healthcare or Change 
   following the transactions. After the separation, Change Healthcare is required under an agreement to pay McKesson 
   85% of the net cash tax savings realized, or so deemed, from the depreciation or amortization allocated to Change by 
   McKesson.  The  receipt  of  any  payments  from  this  agreement  is  dependent  upon  Change  benefiting  from  this 
   depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings, which creates uncertainty such that McKesson accounts for the 
   agreement as a gain contingency. This estimated gain is included under "Equity earnings and charges from investment 
   in Change Healthcare Joint Venture" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(4) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 includes charges of $58 
   million (pre-tax and after-tax) and $275 million (pre-tax and after-tax) to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale 
   to  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  related  to  the  contribution  of  the  majority  of  our  German  pharmaceutical  wholesale 
   business to create a joint venture in which McKesson has a non-controlling interest within our International segment. 
   On November 2, 2020, McKesson announced the completion of the creation of the joint venture. These charges are 
   included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted 
   results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(5) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months and year ended March 31, 2021 includes pre-
   tax charges of $63 million ($47 million after-tax) and $334 million ($275 million after-tax), primarily for our Europe 
   and Canada businesses as well as Corporate expenses, net. The three months and year ended March 31, 2020 includes 
   charges of $64 million ($48 million after-tax) and $268 million ($215 million after-tax), primarily for our Canada and 
   Europe  businesses  as  well  as  Corporate  expenses,  net.  Our  Europe  and  Canada  businesses  are  included  within 
   International. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables. Additionally, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months ended March 31, 2020, 
   and the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 includes immaterial amounts under “gross profit” in the reconciliation 
   of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(6) Claims and litigation charges, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $8.1 billion ($6.8 
   billion after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims of states, their political subdivisions, and 
   other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in 
   the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of 
   the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  2 of 2
                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Claims and litigation charges, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax net gain of $131 million ($97 
   million  after-tax)  related  to  insurance  proceeds  received,  net  of  attorneys'  fees  and  expenses  awarded  to  plaintiffs' 
   counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our controlled 
   substances monitoring program within Corporate expenses, net. This gain is included under "total operating expenses" 
   in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 
   of  the  accompanying  financial  statement  tables.  In  financial  reporting  periods  prior  to  the  three  months  ended 
   December 31, 2020, this gain was included under other adjustments, net.

(8) Claims and litigation charges, net for the year ended March 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $82 million ($61 
   million  after-tax)  recorded  in  connection  with  an  agreement  to  settle  all  opioids  related  claims  filed  by  two  Ohio 
   counties within Corporate expenses, net. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation 
   of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial  statement  tables.  In  financial  reporting  periods  prior  to  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2020,  this 
   charge was included under other adjustments, net.

(9) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31,2020 includes pre-tax charges of $122 million ($90 million after-
   tax)  representing  settlement  charges  related  to  our  frozen  U.S.  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  within  Corporate 
   expenses, net. This charge is included under "other income (expense), net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion ($864 million after-
   tax) representing an other-than-temporary impairment of McKesson’s investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture 
   within Other. This charge is included under “equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare Joint 
   Venture” in the reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $69 
   million  (pre-tax  and  after-tax)  within  International  related  to  our  European  retail  business,  partially  offset  by  the 
   related  indirect  effect  of  $4  million  benefit  in  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests.  This  impairment 
   charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(12) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 million after-
   tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") within U.S. 
   Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down the law as 
   unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering calendar year 
   2019  sales  and  beyond.  In  September  2020,  an  appellate  court  reversed  on  procedural  grounds  the  district  court’s 
   decision.  An  amendment  to  the  Act  made  clear  that  the  OSA  applies  only  to  NY  opioid  sales  or  distributions  for 
   calendar  years  2017  and  2018.  To  the  extent  that  further  court  decisions  do  not  strike  down  the  law,  we  will  face 
   liability  under  the  OSA  and  we  believe  the  estimated  OSA  liability  is  one-time  in  nature  because  the  liability  is 
   retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 2017 and 2018, and is not indicative of future results. Inclusion of 
   this  accrual  in  our  adjusted  results  would  distort  current  period  performance.  This  charge  is  included  under  "total 
   operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
   provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   Adjusted Operating Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Operating Profit as GAAP income (loss) from continuing 
    operations before interest expense and income taxes, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-
    related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 
    impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. 

    The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-
    GAAP measures as defined above:

    Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  -  Amortization  expenses  of  intangible  assets  directly  related  to  business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  -  Transaction,  integration,  and  other  expenses  that  are  directly  related  to 
    business  combinations,  the  formation  of  joint  ventures,  divestitures,  and  other  transaction-related  costs  including  initial 
    public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, 
    retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments 
    including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-related  expenses  or  post-
    closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses on business combinations, and divestitures of businesses that do not 
    qualify as discontinued operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

    Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
    settlements.

    Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change 
    our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted 
    as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure 
    or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, 
    and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product 
    line,  reorganization  or  management  structure  changes,  headcount  rationalization,  realignment  of  operations  or  products, 
    integration  of  acquired  businesses,  and/or  company-wide  cost  saving  initiatives.  The  amount  and/or  frequency  of  these 
    restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
    Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

    Claims  and  litigation  charges  -  Adjustments  to  certain  of  the  Company’s  reserves,  including  those  related  to  estimated 
    probable  settlements  for  its  controlled  substance  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  opioid-related  claims,  as  well  as  any 
    applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees 
    to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on 
    an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-
    inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other 
    similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

    The  Company  evaluates  the  aforementioned  Non-GAAP  measures  on  a  periodic  basis  and  updates  the  definitions  from 
    time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-
    GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided 
    in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

    Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above 
    noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted results per 
    diluted share. 
                                                                                                      3 of 3
                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an 
    FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our 
    operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
    currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-
    Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and 
    adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
    Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
    tables included with this release.

•   Free  Cash  Flow  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  (used  in)  operating  activities  less 
    payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
    consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-
    GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with 
regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s 
future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability 
to  compare  its  financial  results  to  those  of  other  companies  in  the  same  industry.  However,  the  Company's  Non-GAAP 
measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well 
as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability 
of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information  to  provide  a  framework  for  assessing  how  our  business  performed  excluding  the  estimated  effect  of  foreign 
currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  useful  to  investors  as  a 
supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic 
acquisitions,  dividend  payments,  or  other  strategic  uses  of  cash.  Nonetheless,  Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-
GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a  substitute  for,  nor  superior  to,  financial  results  and 
measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
