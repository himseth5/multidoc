       “McKesson continued to demonstrate its operational excellence and extensive healthcare supply 
 chain expertise, as we began the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine doses to the entire U.S. in the third 
 quarter,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “McKesson’s long history of serving as the centralized 
 distributor for the Vaccines for Children program for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
 including during the H1N1 public health crisis, positions us well to distribute hundreds of millions of 
 COVID-19 vaccines safely and efficiently to the right location, in the right quantity, and in the right 
 condition. Our COVID-19 vaccine distribution has been highly successful, achieving all volume and timing 
 requirements by the government, and I want to thank our 80,000 employees around the world for their 
 tremendous efforts and dedication.” 
                          

                                             
                                                                                      

      “While the overall environment remains challenging due to the sustained impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, we are pleased to report third-quarter adjusted earnings results ahead of our expectations. 
McKesson’s performance reflects strong execution and the benefits from our ongoing strategic 
investments in the growth areas of oncology and biopharma services. Based on our year-to-date 
progress and the successful execution of distributing COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies in the 
U.S., we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2021 and now expect Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share of $16.95 to $17.25.” 
 
      Third-quarter revenues were $62.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago, driven by growth in the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to market growth and higher specialty volumes, partially offset by 
branded to generic conversions. 
       
      Third-quarter Loss per diluted share of ($39.03) included a pre-tax $8.1 billion expense accrual 
related to opioid litigation and a pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million primarily 
related to McKesson’s retail pharmacy businesses in the International segment. Third-quarter Adjusted 
Earnings per diluted share does not include these charges. 
       
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $4.60 compared to $3.81 a year ago, an 
increase of 21%, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, 
partially offset by a higher tax rate and the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's now 
separated investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change Healthcare"). Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share also included pre-tax net gains of approximately $30 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, 
associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments. 
       
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $709 million of cash to 
shareholders via $500 million of common stock repurchases and $209 million of dividend payments. 
During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.2 billion, 
and invested $427 million internally, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $745 million.  
       
Opioid-related charges 
   •  In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, McKesson recorded a GAAP-only pre-tax charge of $8.1 billion, 
      $6.7 billion post-tax, related to the estimated liability for opioid-related claims of governmental 
      entities. The Company is in ongoing, advanced discussions with state attorneys general and 
      plaintiffs’ attorneys regarding a settlement framework under which the Company would pay its 
      portion of a broad settlement over a period of 18 years. A loss in this amount has now been 
      deemed probable and reasonably estimable. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $49.5 billion, up 7%, driven by market growth and higher specialty 
      volumes, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $635 million and operating margin was 1.28%. 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $656 million, up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in 
      specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of the company’s strategic 
      growth initiatives. Adjusted operating margin was 1.33%, down 5 basis points. 
 
                         

                                            
                                                                                      

International Segment

      venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($71) million and operating margin was (0.77%), 
      driven by a GAAP-only pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of $115 million primarily related

      Adjusted basis, adjusted operating margin was 1.69%, up 22 basis points. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment

      partially offset by inventory charges. Adjusted operating margin was 9.14%, up 55 basis points.  
 
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $777 million, up 9%, driven by new brand support programs and 
      higher volumes of existing brand support programs. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $114 million and operating margin was 14.67%. 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $131 million, up 27%, reflecting organic growth in the

Fiscal 2021 Outlook 
      McKesson raised and narrowed fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance to 
$16.95 to $17.25 from the previous range of $16.00 to $16.50 to primarily reflect improved growth in the 
business and the contribution from McKesson’s successful distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and 
ancillary supplies. Fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance assumes $0.25 to $0.35 
related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and $0.20 to $0.30 related to the kitting and distribution of 
ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines.  
       
      Fiscal 2021 guidance continues to assume that a full recovery of pharmaceutical prescription 
volumes and patient visits will not occur this fiscal year.

reflects equity earnings and charges for retrospective periods for the company's previous investment in 
Change Healthcare, which was separated from the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare, 
Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted 
Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, 
Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not 
calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” 
section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the 
Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the 
differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP 
financial measures. 
       
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is 
unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most 
directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson 
cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, 

                                            
                                                                                      

restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially.

results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as 
financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent

disputes, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we from time to time record significant charges from 
impairment to goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity 
incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might 
experience significant problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail 
pharmacy profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or

adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may 
experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic 
pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown (including the effects we 
have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession and by disruption in capital and credit 
markets that might impede our access credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial 
soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as 
widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 
pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; and we face uncertainties

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the three and nine months 
     ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended December 31, 2019 using a weighted average of 159.5 million, 161.2 million, and 183.1 million 
     common  shares,  respectively,  which  excludes  dilutive  securities  from  the  denominator  due  to  their  antidilutive  effect  when  calculating  a  net  loss  per 
     diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months 
     ended  December  31,  2019  on  a  fully  diluted  basis,  using  a  weighted  average  of  161.0  million,  162.5  million,  and  184.0  million  common  shares, 
     respectively. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any footing differences in those items are 
     due to different weighted average share counts. This methodology results in per share differences of $0.36, $0.26, and $0.01 for the three and nine months 
     ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
(c)  Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 was $4.58 and $12.15, respectively, 
     which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.02 in both periods.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1) Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  includes  our  proportionate  share  of  loss  from  investment  in  Change 
   Healthcare Joint Venture within Other. Such amount includes the amortization of equity investment intangibles and 
   other acquired intangibles of $63 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $203 million for the nine 
   months ended December 31, 2019. These charges are included under "equity earnings and charges from investment in 
   Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(2) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes a pre-tax charge 
   of $246 million ($184 million after-tax) within Other, representing the difference between our proportionate share of 
   the IPO proceeds and the dilution effect on our investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture carrying value. Upon 
   the completion of the IPO by Change Healthcare Inc. in July 2019, McKesson's equity ownership interest in the joint 
   venture diluted from approximately 70% to 58.5%. This charge is included under "equity earnings and charges from 
   investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. 

(3) Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  December  31,  2020  includes 
   charges of $47 million (pre-tax and after-tax) and $57 million (pre-tax and after-tax), respectively, to remeasure assets 
   and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell related to the contribution of the majority of our German 
   pharmaceutical wholesale business to create a joint venture in which McKesson has a non-controlling interest within 
   our International segment. On November 2, 2020, McKesson announced the completion of the creation of the joint 
   venture. Transaction-related   expenses  and  adjustments  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  December  31,  2019 
   includes a charge of $282 million (pre-tax and after-tax) to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value 
   less  costs  to  sell  related  to  the  joint  venture  for  those  reporting  periods. These   charges  are  included  under  "total 
   operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
   provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(4) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes 
   pre-tax  charges  of  $155  million  ($138  million  after-tax)  and  $271  million  ($227  million  after-tax),  respectively, 
   primarily for our Canada and Europe businesses as well as Corporate expenses, net. The three and nine months ended 
   December 31, 2019 includes charges of $136 million ($115 million after-tax) and $204 million ($167 million after-
   tax), respectively, primarily for our Europe and Canada businesses as well as Corporate expenses, net. Our Europe and 
   Canada businesses are included within International. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in 
   the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of 
   the accompanying financial statement tables. Additionally, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the 
   three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes immaterial amounts under “gross profit” in the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables. 

(5) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of 
   $8.1 billion ($6.7 billion after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims of states, their political 
   subdivisions,  and  other  government  entities,  within  Corporate  expenses,  net.  This  charge  is  included  under  "total 
   operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
   provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(6) Claims and litigation charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax net gain of $131 
   million ($97 million after-tax) related to insurance proceeds received, net of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to 
   plaintiffs' counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our 
   controlled substances monitoring program within Corporate expenses, net. This gain is included under "total operating 
   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement  tables.  In  prior  periods,  this  gain  was  included  under  other 
   adjustments, net. 
                                                                                                  2 of 2
                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Claims and litigation charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes a pre-tax charge of $82 
   million ($61 million after-tax) recorded in connection with an agreement to settle all opioids related claims filed by 
   two Ohio counties within Corporate expenses, net. The related $21 million income tax benefit was recognized in the 
   three and the nine months ended December 31, 2019. This charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables. In prior periods, this charge was included under other adjustments, net. 

(8) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes pre-tax charges of $122 million ($90 
   million  after-tax)  representing  settlement  charges  related  to  our  frozen  U.S.  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  within 
   Corporate  expenses,  net.  This  charge  is  included  under  "other  income  (expense),  net"  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(9) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 includes a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion ($864 
   million after-tax) representing an other-than-temporary impairment of McKesson’s investment in Change Healthcare 
   Joint Venture within Other. This charge is included under “equity earnings and charges from investment in Change 
   Healthcare  Joint  Venture”  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-
   GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge 
   of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, partially offset by the 
   related  indirect  effect  of  $4  million  benefit  in  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests.  This  impairment 
   charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 
   million after-tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") 
   within U.S. Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down 
   the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering 
   calendar  year  2019  sales  and  beyond.  In  September  2020,  an  appellate  court  reversed  on  procedural  grounds  the 
   district  court’s  decision.  An  amendment  to  the  Act  made  clear  that  the  OSA  applies  only  to  NY  opioid  sales  or 
   distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. To the extent that further court decisions do not strike down the law, 
   we will face liability under the OSA and we believe the estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the 
   liability  is  retroactively  imposed  on  sales  or  distributions  in  2017  and  2018,  and  is  not  indicative  of  future  results. 
   Inclusion  of  this  accrual  in  our  adjusted  results  would  distort  current  period  performance.  This  charge  is  included 
   under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-
   GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                       SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by 
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•  Adjusted Gross Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Gross Profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding transaction-
   related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal 
   settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments.

•  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating 
   expenses,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
   restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments.

•  Adjusted Other Income (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Other Income as GAAP other income (expense), net, 
   excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  and  other 
   adjustments.

•  Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Equity Income from Change 
   Healthcare  as  GAAP  equity  earnings  and  charges  from  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture,  excluding 
   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, and other adjustments. 
   We completed the separation from our investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture during the fourth quarter of 
   fiscal 2020. 

•  Adjusted  Income  Tax  Expense  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Income  Tax  Expense  as  GAAP  income  tax 
   benefit  (expense),  excluding  the  income  tax  effects  of  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-
   related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements, 
   restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. Income tax effects 
   are  calculated  in  accordance  with  Accounting  Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  740,  “Income  Taxes,”  which  is  the 
   same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

•  Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations 
   attributable to McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and 
   adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and 
   related charges, claims and litigation charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of 
   these items, as applicable. 

•  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  as  GAAP 
   earnings (loss) per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, excluding per share 
   impacts  of  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO 
   inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, 
   claims and litigation charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as 
   applicable,  divided  by  diluted  weighted-average  shares  outstanding.  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  was  not 
   previously adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the Change Healthcare Joint Venture.

•  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP)  and  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  (Non-
   GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  as  GAAP  segment  operating  profit  (loss),  excluding 
   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related 
   adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  and  other 
   adjustments.  We  define  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  as  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-
   GAAP) divided by GAAP segment revenues.

•  Adjusted Corporate Expenses (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Corporate Expenses as GAAP corporate expenses, 
   net, excluding transaction-related expenses and adjustments, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and 
   litigation charges, and other adjustments. 
                                                                                                  2 of 3
                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Adjusted  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Profit  as  GAAP  income  (loss)  from 
   continuing  operations  before  interest  expense  and  income  taxes,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related 
   intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust 
   legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. 

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

   Additionally,  the  Company's  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture's  financial  results  are  adjusted  for  the 
   above noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted 
   results per diluted share. 
                                                                                                  3 of 3
                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
