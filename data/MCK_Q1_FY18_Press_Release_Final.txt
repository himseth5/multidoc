      SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2017 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 2017 were 
$51.1 billion, up 3% compared to $49.7 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), first-quarter earnings per 
diluted share from continuing operations was $1.44, compared to $2.88 a year 
ago.  
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $2.46, down 22% 
compared to $3.15 a year ago. First-quarter results included the lapping effect of 
the lower profit contribution from increased price competition in our independent 
pharmacy business in Fiscal 2017 and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer 
pricing trends in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within our Distribution 
Solutions segment, and lower profit in our Technology Solutions segment driven 
primarily by the contribution of the majority of the businesses to Change 
Healthcare.  
      For the first quarter, McKesson generated cash from operations of $741 
million, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion. 
During the quarter, McKesson repaid $541 million in long-term debt, paid $1.5 
billion for acquisitions, repurchased $250 million of its common stock, invested 
$118 million internally and paid $62 million in dividends. Yesterday, the Board of 


                                   1 
 Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend from 28 cents to 34 
cents per share. 
      “McKesson’s first-quarter operating results were consistent with our 
expectations,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. 
“We’re off to a solid start to the year and are raising our previous Fiscal 2018 
Adjusted Earnings outlook to a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share. In 
addition, we generated strong first-quarter cash flows, which allowed us to 
allocate capital in line with our portfolio approach to capital deployment.” 
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $50.9 billion for the quarter, up 4% 
on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $43.0 
billion for the quarter were up 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant 
currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 
billion for the quarter, up 1% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency 
basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth. 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up 4% for the 
quarter, driven by market growth.  
      In the first quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $713 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.40%. First-quarter adjusted operating 
profit was $887 million and adjusted operating margin was 1.73%, both on a 
constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling 
interests for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.64% on a constant 
currency basis.  
      Technology Solutions revenues were down 83% on both a reported and 
constant currency basis in the first quarter, following the contribution of the 
majority of our Technology Solutions businesses to the Change Healthcare joint 
venture on March 1, 2017, and reflecting our remaining Enterprise Information 
Solutions business.  


                                    2
       First-quarter GAAP loss from McKesson’s equity investment in Change 
 Healthcare was $120 million. Adjusted income from McKesson’s equity 
 investment in Change Healthcare was $70 million for the first quarter. 
      Technology Solutions GAAP operating loss was $78 million for the first 
quarter. Adjusted operating profit was $87 million for the first quarter, primarily 
reflecting our equity share of Change Healthcare’s net income. 
 
Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook 
      McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share between $7.10 to 
 $9.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, which includes the following 
 items: 
      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted 
       share; 
      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $1.10 to $1.30 per

 Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
 income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-
 Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, 
 restructuring charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s 
 GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 
 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 


                                    3
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
 The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
 currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
 included with this release. 
  
 Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests 
      McKesson also provides adjusted operating profit margin excluding 
 noncontrolling interests. The company has arrangements involving third-party 
 noncontrolling interests. As a result, pre-tax results are affected by the portion of 
 pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted operating profit 
 margin excluding noncontrolling interests information is presented to provide a 
 framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
 effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. The supplemental 
 adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information of 
the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is 
provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release.

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) 
      inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, other adjustments as well as the related 
      income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis 
      and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s 
      presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided 
      in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.

      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  Examples include transaction closing 
      costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and  employee relocation expenses, 
      facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, 
      recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency 
      contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net 
      Asset Exchange.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for significant programs in which we change our 
      operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted. Such charges 
      may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset 
      impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented 
      due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
      realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring 
      charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments 
      due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded.

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses; and other similar substantive 
      and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2
                                SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

    • Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests (Non-GAAP): The Company has arrangements involving third-
      party noncontrolling interests. As a result, our pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling 
      interests. To provide additional useful information to investors, we present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling 
      interests for our Distribution Solutions segment. We believe such information provides a framework for assessing how our business 
      performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. We calculate adjusted operating profit excluding 
      noncontrolling interests by removing pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from adjusted operating profit (Non-GAAP).  
      Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit excluding 
      noncontrolling interests with the applicable segment’s revenues. This information is supplemental to the Company’s GAAP financial 
      results and is provided in Schedule 3 of this document. 

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the Company has arrangements involving third party 
noncontrolling interests. As a result, our pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We 
present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the effect of net income that is not attributable to McKesson. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures 
disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated 
in accordance with GAAP.
