•  Revenues of $52.6 billion for the first quarter, up 3% year over year. 
•  First-quarter GAAP loss per diluted share from continuing operations of 
   $(0.69).  
•  First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $2.90, up 18% year 
   over year. 
•  Fiscal 2019 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $13.00 to $13.80 per diluted 
   share. 
•  Board of Directors approved raising the quarterly dividend by 15% from  
   34 cents to 39 cents per share. 
 
      SAN FRANCISCO, July 26, 2018 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the first quarter ended June 30, 
2018, were $52.6 billion, up 3% compared to $51.1 billion a year ago. On a 
constant currency basis, revenues increased 2% over the prior year. On the 
basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), first-quarter 
loss per diluted share from continuing operations was $(0.69), compared to 
earnings per diluted share of $1.44 a year ago. GAAP loss per diluted share 
included a pre-tax and after-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $570 
million, or $2.81 per diluted share, in the European Pharmaceutical Solutions 
segment, primarily triggered by additional U.K. government reimbursement 
reductions announced on June 29, 2018, as well as the change to the 
company’s segment reporting structure. 
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $2.90, up 18% 
compared to $2.46 a year ago, driven by a lower tax rate and share count, 
and growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. 
      For the first quarter, McKesson used $1.1 billion in cash from 
operations, and invested $145 million internally, resulting in negative free 
cash flow of $1.2 billion, in line with the company’s expectations. During the 
quarter, McKesson also paid $826 million for acquisitions, repurchased 
approximately $300 million of its common stock, paid $71 million in dividends 
and the company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 
billion. 


                                  1 
      “McKesson’s first quarter adjusted earnings results were in line with our 
expectations. We are, however, disappointed by the recent government-
initiated reimbursement cuts in the U.K. These incremental cuts create 
ongoing challenges in our U.K. retail pharmacy business,” said John H. 
Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. “During the quarter, we 
began executing against our multi-year strategic growth initiative, which 
included our acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors. And I am pleased 
with the initial progress made on transforming our operating model, which will 
allow us to become a more efficient organization, and drive savings that will 
help fund investments in our priority growth areas.”  
 
New Segment Financial Reporting Effective Fiscal Year 2019 
      As previously disclosed on May 24, 2018, McKesson revised its 
reportable segments effective with the first quarter of Fiscal 2019. 
McKesson’s new reportable segments are: 
   •  U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions; 
   •  European Pharmaceutical Solutions; and 
   •  Medical-Surgical Solutions.  
      All remaining operating segments and business activities are included 
in Other. Other primarily includes McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription 
Technology Solutions (MRxTS) and the company’s equity method investment 
in Change Healthcare. 
 
Segment Results 
      U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues were $41.0 
billion for the quarter, up 2%, driven primarily by market growth and 
acquisitions, partially offset by previously announced customer losses and 
branded to generic conversions. Segment GAAP operating profit was $543 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.33%. Segment adjusted operating 
profit was $540 million and adjusted operating margin was 1.32%.  
      European Pharmaceutical Solutions revenues were $6.9 billion for the 
quarter, up 9% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis, 
driven primarily by market growth and acquisitions, largely offset by the 
previously disclosed increased competition in France and a reduction in 


                                  2 
owned retail pharmacies in the U.K. versus the prior year. Segment GAAP 
operating loss was $560 million and GAAP operating margin was (8.07)%. 
Segment adjusted operating profit was $74 million and adjusted operating 
margin was 1.07%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit 
was $69 million and adjusted operating margin was 1.07%. 
      Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, 
up 11%, driven primarily by market growth and an acquisition. Segment 
GAAP operating profit was $93 million and GAAP operating margin was 
5.46%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $125 million and adjusted 
operating margin was 7.34%. 
      Other revenues were $3.0 billion for the quarter, up 5% on a reported 
basis and 1% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth, 
mostly offset by the impact of government actions on the McKesson Canada 
business. Other GAAP operating profit was $114 million and adjusted 
operating profit was $213 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted 
operating profit was $204 million. 
 
Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook  
      McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.00 to 
$13.80 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.  
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this 
forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-
looking GAAP measure without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the 
company’s control. 
 
Dividend Declaration 
      The company’s Board of Directors yesterday declared a regular 
dividend of $0.39 cents per share of common stock, a 15% increase from 
$0.34 cents per share in the prior quarter. The dividend will be payable on 
October 1, 2018, to stockholders of record on September 4, 2018. 
 
                         


                                  3 
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as 
GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and 
adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal 
settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, and other 
adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement 
tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related 
adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset 
impairment charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, 
many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any 
associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary 
materially. 
       
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency 
basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, 
including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the 
comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected 
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency 
information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the 
company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant currency information 
of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) 
is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 


                                  4 
Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free 
cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less property 
acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the 
company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

customer or group purchasing organization; the loss of government contracts 
as a result of compliance or funding challenges; public health issues in the 
U.S. or abroad; cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction of sophisticated 
internal computer systems to perform as designed; the adequacy of insurance 
to cover property loss or liability claims; the company’s proprietary products 
and services may not be adequately protected, and its products and solutions 
may be found to infringe on the rights of others; system errors or failure of our

event causing interruption of customer access to data residing in our service 
centers; changes in circumstances that could impair our goodwill or intangible

relationships; risks associated with the company’s retail expansion; and the 
company’s inability to keep existing retail store locations or open new retail 
locations in desirable places. The reader should not place undue reliance on

made. Except to the extent required by law, the company undertakes no 
obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-
looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, or

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  Fiscal year 2019 diluted loss per share, as reported under GAAP, is calculated using a weighted average of 202 million common shares and excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects. Potentially 
     dilutive securities were excluded from the fiscal year 2019 GAAP per share computations due to our reported net loss for fiscal year 2019. Diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP), and GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items, are 
     calculated using a weighted average of 203 million common shares and includes dilutive securities.  
(c)  Adjusted Earnings per share on a Constant Currency basis for fiscal year 2019 was $2.85 per diluted share, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.05 per diluted share.

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) 
      inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, other adjustments as 
      well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings 
      on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects 
      of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-
      GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.

      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  Examples include transaction closing 
      costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, 
      facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, 
      recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency 
      contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net 
      Asset Exchange.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring and asset impairment charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we 
      change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted, 
      as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or 
      consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other 
      related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization 
      or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost 
      saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes 
      normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from 
      the Adjusted Earnings. 

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; other asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; certain 
      discrete benefits related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt 
      extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2
                                SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures 
disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated 
in accordance with GAAP.
