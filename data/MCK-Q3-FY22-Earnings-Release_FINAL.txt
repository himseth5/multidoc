      "Our dedicated team members delivered another quarter of strong financial results, demonstrating 
our continued focus on our strategic growth initiatives, company priorities, and value creation for all 
stakeholders," said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. "As a result of our underlying business performance 
across all segments, and our ongoing support of the COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our 
previous guidance range for fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share to $23.55 to $23.95." 
 
      Third-quarter revenues were $68.6 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by 
growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from retail national account 
customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
 
      Third-quarter loss per diluted share from continuing operations of ($0.04) included an after-tax 
charge of $829 million for the fair value remeasurement related to McKesson’s previously announced 
agreement to sell the retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom. Third-quarter Adjusted 
Earnings per Diluted Share did not include these charges. 
       
      Third-quarter fiscal year 2021 loss per diluted share of ($39.03) included a pre-tax $8.1 billion 
expense accrual related to the opioid litigation. 
 
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.15 compared to $4.60 a year ago, an 
increase of 34%, driven by strong operating performance across the segments, the contribution from 
COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs with the U.S. government, and a lower share 
count.  
       
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $2.0 billion of common stock repurchases and $206 million of dividend payments. During the 
first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.5 billion, and invested 
$380 million in capital expenditures, resulting in Free Cash Flow of $1.2 billion. 
 
Business Highlights 
   •  Through January 31, 2022, U.S. Pharmaceutical successfully shipped over 370 million vaccines on 
      behalf of the U.S. government. McKesson continues to play a leading role in the fight against 
      COVID-19. 
   •  McKesson continued to progress in its planned exit from Europe, closing two transactions in the 
      quarter: 
         ◦  After entering an agreement in November 2021 to sell the remaining share of GEHE Pharma 
            Handel and Alliance Healthcare Deutschland joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance, 
            McKesson closed the transaction on January 31, 2022. 
         ◦  After entering an agreement in December 2021 to sell its Austrian business to Quadrifolia 
            Management GmbH, McKesson closed the transaction on January 31, 2022. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $55.0 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by higher volumes from retail 
      national account customers and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $744 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $735 million, an increase of 12%, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and 
      growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. 
 


                                             
                                                                                        

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of 33%, driven by volume growth related to 
      biopharma services, including third party logistic services and increased technology service revenue, 
      partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes.  
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $129 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $145 million, an increase of 11%, driven by growth from access and adherence solutions. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by growth and improvements in 
      the primary care business and the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary 
      supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, partially offset by lower revenue 
      from COVID-19 tests. 
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $308 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $330 million, an increase of 18%, driven by the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of 
      ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and growth in the primary 
      care business.  
 
International Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $9.5 billion on a reported and FX-Adjusted basis, an increase of 2%, 
      driven by sales to new customers in the Canadian business, partially offset by the contribution of 
      McKesson's German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots 
      Alliance.  
   •  Third-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($668) million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted 
      Segment Operating Profit was $223 million, an increase of 41%, driven by the reduction over the 
      prior year of depreciation and amortization on European assets under agreements to sell and the 
      distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and personal protective equipment. 
 
Company Updates  
   •  On December 8, 2021, McKesson hosted an Investor Day where management highlighted progress 
      against the company’s growth strategies and presented compelling long-term financial targets. 
   •  In December 2021, McKesson announced a $4.0 billion increase to the share repurchase program 
      authorized by the Board of Directors. 
   •  As part of the ongoing leadership refreshment of our Board of Directors, James H. Hinton and 
      Kathleen Wilson-Thompson joined the company’s Board of Directors on January 13, 2022, and 
      Donald R. Knauss was elected independent chair effective April 1, 2022, following a planned 
      transition led by current independent chair Edward A. Mueller.   
   •  For the ninth consecutive year, McKesson was named as one of the "Best Places to Work for 
      LGBTQ Equality" by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. McKesson achieved a perfect 
      score on the HRC's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, a nationally recognized benchmarking report on 
      corporate policies and practices in support of LGBTQ+ workplace equality. 
       


                                             
                                                                                        

Fiscal 2022 Outlook 
      McKesson raised fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95 
from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95 to reflect strong operating performance and increased 
contribution from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs.  
 
      Fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes approximately $2.99 to $3.59 of 
impacts attributable to the following: 
   •  $1.75 to $2.15 related to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage 
      programs; 
   •  $0.75 to $0.95 related to the COVID-19 tests and impairments for personal protective equipment 
      and related products; 
   •  $0.49 related to year-to-date gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity 
      investments. 
 
      Excluding the impacts of the above items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results 
indicate 27% to 33% forecasted growth compared to prior year. 
 
      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted 
Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment 
Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted 
Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in 
accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the 
accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP 
financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
       
       
       
       


                                             
                                                                                        

      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially. 
       
Cautionary Statements 
      This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements

“should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “projects,” “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words 
or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, trends, strategy, plans, assumptions, 
or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements, such as financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they 
are first made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise our 
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to

in our most recent annual and periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 
and settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation 
or challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to 
goodwill, intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and 
might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience 
significant problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy 
profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-
renewal; our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be 
harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by 
delays or other difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as 
changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions 
in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and 
changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession 
and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access to credit, increase our 
borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely 
impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events 
outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced 
from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; we may be 
adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; 
and we face uncertainties and risks related to COVID-19 vaccination mandates and to vaccination 
distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  We  calculate  loss  per  diluted  common  share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  McKesson  Corporation  (GAAP)  for  the  three  months  ended 
     December 31, 2021 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 using a weighted average of 151.6 million, 159.5 million, and 161.2 million 
     common  shares,  respectively,  which  excludes  dilutive  securities  from  the  denominator  due  to  their  antidilutive  effect  when  calculating  a  net  loss  per 
     diluted  share.  We  calculate  adjusted  earnings  per  diluted  share  (Non-GAAP)  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021  and  the  three  and  nine 
     months ended December 31, 2020 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 153.5 million, 161.0 million, and 162.5 million common shares, 
     respectively. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any footing differences in those items are 
     due to different weighted average share counts. This methodology results in per share differences of $0.36 and $0.26 for the three and nine months ended 
     December 31, 2020, respectively.
(c)  Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $6.15 and $17.75, respectively,  
     which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of zero and $0.11, respectively.

                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Claims  and  litigation  charges,  net  for  the  nine  months  ended  December  31,  2021  includes  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $27 
   million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims with the State of New York and 
   its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million 
   after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of 
   participating states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These 
   charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(8) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of 
   $8.1 billion ($6.7 billion after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims of states, their political 
   subdivisions,  and  other  government  entities,  within  Corporate  expenses,  net.  This  charge  is  included  under  "total 
   operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
   provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(9) Claims and litigation charges, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax net gain of $131 
   million ($97 million after-tax) related to insurance proceeds received, net of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to 
   plaintiffs' counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our 
   controlled substances monitoring program within Corporate expenses, net. This gain is included under "total operating 
   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million ($141 
   million after-tax) on debt extinguishment related to our July 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our existing debt. 
   This  charge  is  included  under  "loss  on  debt  extinguishment"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating 
   results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical  Solutions.  These  charges  are  driven  by  the  intent  of  management  to  not  sell  this  excess  inventory  which 
   required inventory write downs to zero net realizable value, and instead direct it to charitable organizations. A portion 
   of this inventory was committed for donation during our first quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this expected 
   in-kind donation of inventory in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of 
   normal business operations and is therefore excluded from our determination of adjusted results. A pre-tax charge of 
   $147 million ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which 
   we  no  longer  plan  to  sell  and  instead  plan  to  donate,  and  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $8  million  ($6  million  after-tax)  is 
   included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  related  to  the  already  committed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(12) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge 
   of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, partially offset by the 
   related  indirect  effect  of  $4  million  benefit  in  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests.  This  impairment 
   charge is included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  3 of 3


                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(13) Other adjustments, net for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million ($37 
   million after-tax) related to our estimated liability under the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") 
   within U.S. Pharmaceutical for calendar years 2017 and 2018. In December 2018, a federal district court struck down 
   the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY covering 
   calendar  year  2019  sales  and  beyond.  In  September  2020,  an  appellate  court  reversed  on  procedural  grounds  the 
   district  court’s  decision.  An  amendment  to  the  Act  made  clear  that  the  OSA  applies  only  to  NY  opioid  sales  or 
   distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. On October 4, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court denied further review, 
   and,  as  a  result,  we  anticipate  facing  liability  under  the  OSA  for  calendar  years  2017  and  2018.  We  believe  the 
   estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the liability is retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 
   2017 and 2018, and is not indicative of future results. Inclusion of this accrual in our adjusted results would distort 
   current  period  performance.  This  charge  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
