      “McKesson delivered second quarter results above expectations, demonstrating continued progress 
against our company priorities,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “This performance and continued 
momentum reflect the dedication and contribution of our McKesson team members. The continued strength of 
our differentiated capabilities in our oncology and biopharma services platforms positions McKesson to deliver 
sustainable growth and compelling long-term shareholder value. As a result of our first half performance and 
outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per 
Diluted Share to $26.80 to $27.40.” 
       
      Second quarter revenues were $77.2 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Revenue increases 
were primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription 
volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products, and GLP-1 
medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the divestitures of 
McKesson’s European businesses.

3 Adjusted results in this earnings release are non-GAAP financial measures; refer to the accompanying definitions, reconciliation schedules, and schedule 2 
   
       

      Second quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $4.92 compared to $6.46 a 
year ago, a decrease of $1.54, which includes a pre-tax provision for bad debts of $210 million within the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical segment for uncollected trade accounts receivable related to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid 
Corporation.  
 
      Second quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.23 compared to $6.06 a year ago, an 
increase of 3%, driven by a lower share count and growth in the Prescription Technology Solutions and U.S. 
Pharmaceutical segments, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Second quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted 
Share also included pre-tax losses of approximately $10 million associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity 
investments, compared to pre-tax losses of approximately $3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
      For the first six months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which 
included $1.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $149 million of dividend payments. During the first six 
months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $87 million, and invested $264 million in 
capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $351 million.

Executive Leadership Transition 
   •  Lori Schechter, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer & General Counsel, has made the 
      decision to retire from McKesson in June 2024. On January 1, 2024, Lori will assume the role of Board 
      and Enterprise Risk Advisor and step down as an Executive Officer of the company, a role she has held 
      since June 2014.  
   •  With Lori’s decision to retire, we are also announcing the appointment of Michele Lau as Executive Vice 
      President and Chief Legal Officer, effective January 1, 2024. For the past two and a half years, Michele 
      has served as Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary for GoDaddy. Prior to that role, Michele spent 
      thirteen years as a member of McKesson’s General Counsel Organization, most recently as Senior 
      Vice President, Corporate Secretary & Associate General Counsel. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Revenues were $69.8 billion, an increase of 16%, driven by increased prescription volumes, including 
      higher volumes from retail national account customers, specialty products, and GLP-1 medications, 
      partially offset by branded to generic conversions.  


                                              
       

   •  Segment Operating Profit was $593 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $815 million, an 
      increase of 8%, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health 
      systems and increased contributions from our generics program. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 
      vaccine distribution from fiscal 2023, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit growth of 15%. 
 
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by increased prescription volumes in our 
      technology services and third-party logistics businesses. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $238 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $209 million, an 
      increase of 48%, driven by higher demand for access solutions, primarily related to prior authorization 
      services due to increased prescription volumes. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Revenues were $2.8 billion, flat to the prior year, driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower 
      contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s 
      COVID-19 vaccine program. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $244 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $254 million, a 
      decrease of 17%, driven by lower contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies 
      for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program and lower sales of COVID-19 tests. Excluding 
      the impact of COVID-19 related items from fiscal 2023, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment 
      delivered Adjusted Segment Operating Profit growth of 5%, driven by growth in the extended care 
      business due to increased volumes of nutritional supplements. 
 
International Segment 
   •  Revenues were $3.5 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 43%, 
      driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $66 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $93 million, a decrease of 32%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s European 
      businesses. 
 
Fiscal 2024 Outlook 
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the Company is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort. McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO 
inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and 
related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are generally 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any 
associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.  
 
      McKesson is raising fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $26.80 to $27.40 
from the previous range of $26.55 to $27.35 to reflect solid operating business performance. 
 
      Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes ($0.10) related to year-to-date 
losses associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments. Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted 
Share Excluding Certain Items guidance indicates 14% to 17% forecasted growth compared to prior year. 
       
      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

                                     FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 includes pre-tax  
     gains  of  $48  million  ($35  million  after-tax)  and  $76  million  ($56  million  after-tax),  respectively,  related  to  fair  value 
     remeasurements of the contingent consideration liability recognized as part of our acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions, 
     LLC. The gains, within Prescription Technology Solutions, resulted from remeasurement of the liability to fair value at 
     the  end  of  each  reporting  period  based  on  the  estimated  amount  and  timing  of  projected  operational  and  financial 
     information and the probability of achievement of performance milestones. These pre-tax gains are included under "total 
     operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP) 
     provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(2)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 includes pre-tax 
     gains of $23 million ($3 million after-tax) and $35 million (charge of $1 million after-tax), respectively, related to an 
     agreement to sell certain of our European businesses to the PHOENIX Group which closed on October 31, 2022. Pre-tax 
     gains for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 of $166 million ($146 million after-tax) and $272 million 
     ($236 million after-tax), respectively, are included within Corporate expenses, net, and charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of 
     $143  million  and  $237  million,  respectively,  are  included  within  International.  These  pre-tax  gains  and  charges  are 
     primarily to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell, including the effect of accumulated 
     other  comprehensive  income  balances  associated  with  the  disposal  group,  and  are  included  under  "total  operating 
     expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in 
     Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(3)  Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 includes a pre-tax 
     gain  of  $142  million  ($105  million  after-tax)  related  to  the  exit  of  an  investment  in  equity  securities  within  U.S. 
     Pharmaceutical.  This  gain  is  included  under  "other  income,  net"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating 
     results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(4)  Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 includes pre-
     tax  charges  of  $28  million  ($21  million  after-tax)  and  $80  million  ($60  million  after-tax),  respectively,  primarily  for 
     Corporate expenses, net. The three and six months ended September 30, 2022 includes pre-tax charges of $30 million 
     ($24 million after-tax) and $53 million ($41 million after-tax), respectively, primarily for Corporate expenses, net. These 
     charges  are  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to 
     adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(5)  Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 includes a pre-tax provision for bad debts 
     of $210 million ($155 million after-tax) within U.S. Pharmaceutical related to the bankruptcy of our customer, Rite Aid 
     Corporation  (including  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  “Rite  Aid”).  Management  believes  this  charge  is  not  reflective  of 
     allowances  recorded  in  the  normal  course  of  operations  and  is  related  to  Rite  Aid's  bankruptcy  reorganization,  and 
     therefore is excluded from the determination of our adjusted results (Non-GAAP). This charge represents the remaining 
     uncollected trade accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2023 due to us from Rite Aid and is included under 
     “total operating expenses” in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) 
     provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                      1 of 3

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In  an  effort  to  provide  investors  with  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's  financial  results  as  determined  by 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP"),  McKesson  Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "we")  also  presents  the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•   Adjusted  Gross  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Gross  Profit  as  GAAP  gross  profit,  excluding  transaction-
    related  expenses  and  adjustments,  last-in,  first-out  (“LIFO”)  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal 
    settlements, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating 
    expenses,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    restructuring, impairment, and related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Other  Income  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Other  Income  as  GAAP  other  income  (expense),  net, 
    excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  and  other 
    adjustments.

•   Adjusted  Interest  Expense  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Interest  Expense  as  GAAP  interest  expense,  excluding 
    transaction-related expenses and adjustments related to net interest expense incurred from cross-currency swaps used to 
    hedge  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  notes  resulting  from  changes  in 
    benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency-denominated notes were previously 
    designated  as  non-derivative  net  investment  hedges  of  portions  of  the  Company's  net  investments  in  its  now-divested 
    European businesses against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the 
    U.S. dollar.

•   Adjusted Income Tax Expense (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Income Tax Expense as GAAP income tax benefit 
    (expense), excluding the income tax effects of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses 
    and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and 
    related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. Income tax effects are calculated in accordance with 
    Accounting  Standards  Codification  ("ASC")  740,  “Income  Taxes,”  which  is  the  same  accounting  principle  used  by  the 
    Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

•   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable 
    to  McKesson,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments, 
    LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, 
    claims  and  litigation  charges,  other  adjustments,  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as 
    applicable. 

•   Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share as GAAP earnings 
    per  diluted  common  share  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  McKesson,  excluding  per  share  impacts  of 
    amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related 
    adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and  litigation 
    charges,  other  adjustments,  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as  applicable,  divided  by 
    diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

•   Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  Excluding  Certain  Items  (Non-GAAP):  Prior  to  fiscal  2024,  we  defined 
    Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  Excluding  Certain  Items  as  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  (Non-GAAP), 
    excluding the impacts of the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution program, the U.S. government's kitting, 
    storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines program, sales of COVID-19 tests, net gains and 
    losses  associated  with  McKesson  Ventures'  equity  investments,  and  the  gain  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended 
    December  31,  2022  related  to  termination  of  the  Tax  Receivable  Agreement  ("TRA")  with  Change  Healthcare  Inc. 
    ("Change"), as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable, divided by diluted weighted-
    average  shares  outstanding.  In  fiscal  2024,  we  define  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  Excluding  Certain  Items  as 
    Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  (Non-GAAP),  excluding  the  impacts  of  net  gains  and  losses  associated  with 
    McKesson Ventures' equity investments, as well as the related income tax effects for this item, as applicable, divided by 
    diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
                                                                                                      2 of 3
                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    The following provides further details regarding certain adjustments made to our fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted

    Items (Non-GAAP) as defined above:

    U.S.  government's  COVID-19  vaccine  distribution  program  -  The  Company  distributes  certain  COVID-19  vaccines  in 
    support of the U.S. government through a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results of

    results of operations. These items are reflected in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.

    acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains

    revenues.

•   Adjusted Corporate Expenses (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Corporate Expenses as GAAP corporate expenses, net,

    The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-
    GAAP measures as defined above:

    Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  -  Amortization  charges  for  intangible  assets  directly  related  to  business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  -  Transaction,  integration,  and  other  expenses  that  are  directly  related  to 
    business  combinations,  the  formation  of  joint  ventures,  divestitures,  and  other  transaction-related  costs  including  initial 
    public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, 
    retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments 
    including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-related  expenses  or  post-
    closing expenses, net interest expense impact of hedging foreign currency-denominated notes, bridge loan fees and gains or 
    losses on business combinations, and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash charges or credit adjustments.

    Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust legal settlements.
                                                                                                      3 of 3

                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change 
    our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted 
    as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure 
    or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, 
    and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product 
    line,  reorganization  or  management  structure  changes,  headcount  rationalization,  realignment  of  operations  or  products, 
    integration  of  acquired  businesses,  and/or  company-wide  cost  saving  initiatives.  The  amount  and/or  frequency  of  these 
    restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
    Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

    Claims  and  litigation  charges  -  Adjustments  to  certain  of  the  Company’s  reserves,  including  those  related  to  estimated 
    probable  settlements  for  its  controlled  substance  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  opioid-related  claims,  as  well  as  any 
    applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees 
    to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred. This also may include charges or credits for general non-operational 
    claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on 
    an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-
    inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other 
    similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

    The  Company  evaluates  the  aforementioned  Non-GAAP  measures  on  a  periodic  basis  and  updates  the  definitions  from 
    time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-
    GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided 
    in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an 
    FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our 
    operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
    currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-
    Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and 
    adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
    Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
    tables included with this release.

•   Free  Cash  Flow  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  (used  in)  operating  activities  less 
    payments  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
    consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-
    GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with 
regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s 
future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability 
to  compare  its  financial  results  to  those  of  other  companies  in  the  same  industry.  However,  the  Company's  Non-GAAP 
measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well 
as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pound sterling. As a result, the comparability 
of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information  to  provide  a  framework  for  assessing  how  our  business  performed  excluding  the  estimated  effect  of  foreign 
currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  useful  to  investors  as  a 
supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic 
acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP adjusted results 
and related Non-GAAP measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial 
results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
