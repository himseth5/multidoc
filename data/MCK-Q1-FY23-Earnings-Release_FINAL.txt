      “McKesson had a solid start to fiscal 2023. Our results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our 
streamlined portfolio and successful execution as a diversified healthcare services company,” said Brian Tyler, 
chief executive officer. “Our talented associates continue to deliver exceptional performance, and we remain 
confident that our strategy positions McKesson for long-term growth and value creation. As a result of our first-
quarter operating performance and the continuation of COVID-19 response efforts, we are raising our guidance 
for fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share to $23.95 to $24.65.” 
       
      First-quarter revenues were $67.2 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago, driven by growth in the 
U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national 
account customers, and market growth, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a 
result of the planned progress with McKesson’s divestiture of its European businesses. 
 
      First-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $5.25 compared to $3.09 a 
year ago, an increase of $2.16. 
 
      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $5.83 compared to $5.56 a year ago, an 
increase of 5%, driven by growth across the North American businesses and a lower share count, partially 
offset by a higher tax rate and lower contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage 
programs with the U.S. government. First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share also included pre-tax 
net losses of approximately $22 million associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments, compared to 
pre-tax net gains of approximately $7 million in the first-quarter of fiscal 2022.  
       
      For the first three months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $1.0 billion of common stock repurchases and $71 million of dividend payments. During the first 
three months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $941 million, and invested $100 
million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $1.0 billion. 
 
Capital Deployment Updates 
      McKesson maintains a disciplined approach to capital allocation, centered on delivering sustainable 
growth and long-term shareholder value. McKesson’s capital allocation framework consists of three pillars: 
   •  Prioritizing growth by investing internally and making acquisitions that support our strategic priorities. 
   •  Returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and McKesson’s commitment to a 
      growing dividend. Share repurchases are principally used to return cash to shareholders in absence of 
      growth investment opportunities.  
   •  Maintaining a strong balance sheet, including strong Free Cash Flow generation, which provides ample 
      liquidity and financial flexibility. 
    
      On July 22, 2022, McKesson’s Board of Directors declared a 15% increase to its quarterly dividend 
from $0.47 per share to $0.54 per share.  
       
      On July 22, 2022, McKesson’s Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an 
additional $4.0 billion of its common shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its 
stockholders, considering other growth opportunities and prevailing business and market conditions. Fiscal 
2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance continues to assume approximately $3.5 billion of share 
repurchases.                       


                                              
       

Business Highlights 
   •  Oncology: On June 23, 2022, McKesson announced an agreement to form a joint venture combining 
      McKesson's U.S. Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research Institute. 
      Together, the joint venture will create a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at 
      expanding clinical research, accelerating drug development, and increasing availability and access to 
      clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved 
      communities. The transaction is anticipated to close in 2022.  
   •  Europe: McKesson progressed in its planned exit of business operations within the European region 
      and has completed divestitures or entered into agreements to sell 11 of the 12 countries. 
         ◦  After entering into an agreement in June 2022 to sell its Denmark business to Erhvervsinvest, 
            McKesson closed the transaction on July 29, 2022. 
         ◦  After entering into an agreement in November 2021 to sell its UK business to AURELIUS, 
            McKesson closed the transaction on April 6, 2022. 
         ◦  In July 2021, McKesson announced an agreement to sell certain McKesson Europe businesses 
            in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the PHOENIX Group. The 
            transaction is expected to close in the second half of fiscal 2023.  
         ◦  Norway remains the only country that McKesson has not entered into an agreement to sell. 
   •  COVID-19: McKesson continues to play a leading role in the fight against COVID-19. McKesson 
      renewed its partnership with the U.S. government to support the COVID-19 response efforts. The 
      vaccine distribution contract has been extended through July 2023; and the kitting, storage, and 
      distribution of ancillary supplies contract has been extended through January 2023. 
             
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $56.9 billion, an increase of 14%, resulting from increased specialty 
      product volumes, including retail national account customers, and market growth, partially offset by 
      branded to generic conversions.  
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $696 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $711 
      million, an increase of 4%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health 
      systems, partially offset by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Excluding the impact of 
      COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit growth of 9%. 
       
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 21%, driven by our biopharma services 
      programs due to prescription volume growth, and third-party logistics and technology service revenues. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $144 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $165 
      million, an increase of 19%, driven by growth from access, affordability, and adherence solutions. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by growth in the primary care 
      business, partially offset by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting, storage, 
      and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $256 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $268 
      million, an increase of 4%, driven by organic business performance as well as growth and 
      improvements in the primary care business. 
 

                                              
       

International Segment 
   •  First-quarter revenues were $6.5 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $7.1 billion, a 
      decrease of 23%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s UK and Austrian businesses. 
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Loss was $6 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $152 million, a decrease of 11%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson’s Austrian 
      and UK businesses, partially offset by the reduction of depreciation and amortization on European 
      assets under agreements to sell. 
 
Opioid-Related Litigation 
   •  McKesson has settled, or reached agreements to settle, the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as 
      well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. 
         ◦  On May 3, 2022, McKesson reached an agreement in principle with the State of Washington. 
         ◦  On June 27, 2022, McKesson reached an agreement in principle with the State of Oklahoma. 
         ◦  On July 4, 2022, after a full trial, a federal judge ruled that McKesson along with two other 
            distributors could not be held liable to two West Virginia subdivisions for contributing to the 
            opioid crisis. 
             
Corporate Responsibility Updates 
   •  McKesson was recognized by Forbes as one of the “Best Employers for Women,” achieving an 
      industry-leading ranking and demonstrating its outstanding progress in promoting gender equity and 
      diversity in the workplace. 
   •  For the seventh consecutive year, McKesson was named a “Best Place to Work for Disability 
      Inclusion.” McKesson earned a top-ranking score of 100 on the 2022 Disability Equality Index®, a joint 
      initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities and Disability:IN. 
 
Fiscal 2023 Outlook 
      McKesson raised fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $23.95 to $24.65 from 
the previous range of $22.90 to $23.60 to reflect first-quarter operating performance and increased contribution 
from the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs and COVID-19 tests. 
 
      Fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes approximately $0.99 to $1.29 of

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP 
financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted 
Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted 
Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, 
Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are 
financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial 
Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the 
Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences 
between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
       
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably 
forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, 
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s 
control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements 
      This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements 
may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” 
“seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans”,” estimates” or the negative of these words or other 
comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, trends, strategy, plans, assumptions, or intentions 
may also include forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking 
statements, such as financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. 
Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking 
statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such 
risks and uncertainties, we encourage investors to read the risk factors described in our most recent annual 
and periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
       

                                              
       

      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes and 
settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation or 
challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, 
intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might 
experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience significant 
problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we 
might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our 
contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by 
changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by delays or other 
difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing 
and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and 
we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russo-Ukrainian War on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access 
to credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we 
might be adversely impacted by monetary inflation or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might 
be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the 
effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events (such as the 
Russo-Ukrainian War) and other catastrophic events; we may be adversely affected by global climate change 
or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; and we face uncertainties and risks related to 
COVID-19 vaccination distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months ended June 30, 2022 includes pre-tax charges 
   of  $23  million  ($17  million  after-tax)  primarily  for  Corporate  expenses,  net  as  well  as  Prescription  Technology 
   Solutions. The three months ended June 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $158 million ($129 million after-tax) 
   primarily  for  Corporate  expenses,  net  as  well  as  our  Canada  and  Europe  businesses.  Our  Europe  and  Canada 
   businesses  are  included  within  International.  These  charges  are  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

(2) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three month ended June 30, 2021 includes a pre-tax charge of $27 million 
   ($22  million  after-tax)  related  to  an  agreement  to  settle  opioid-related  claims  with  the  State  of  New  York  and  its 
   participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million 
   after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of 
   participating states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These 
   charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(3) Other  adjustments,  net  for  the three   months  ended  June  30,  2021  includes  pre-tax  charges  of  $155  million  ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical  Solutions.  These  charges  are  driven  by  the  intent  of  management  to  not  sell  this  excess  inventory  which 
   required  inventory  write  downs  to  zero  net  realizable  value,  and  instead  direct  it  to  charitable  organizations  or 
   otherwise dispose. A portion of this inventory was committed for donation to charitable organizations during our first 
   quarter of fiscal 2022, which was delivered during fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this inventory which is no longer 
   intended for sale in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of normal business 
   operations  and  is  therefore  excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  A  pre-tax  charge  of  $147  million 
   ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which we no longer 
   plan  to  sell,  and  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $8  million  ($6  million  after-tax)  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses" 
   related  to  the  completed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees  to  defend  claims,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  This  also  may  include  charges  or  credits  for  general  non-
   operational claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3


                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
