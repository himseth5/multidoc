      “I am proud of the dedication and discipline of McKesson’s employees as we navigate the 
complexities and uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to serve our customers and 
our communities” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “Thanks to the strong execution of our 
employees around the world, McKesson delivered first-quarter results ahead of our original expectations, 
as volumes across the business improved earlier than anticipated. Based on our first-quarter 
performance and current outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous guidance 
range for fiscal 2021 and now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $14.70 to $15.50”. 
 
      First-quarter revenues were $55.7 billion, flat year-over-year, as market growth and higher 
volumes from retail national account customers within the U.S Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions 
segment were largely offset by the impact of lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits 
across the enterprise. 
       


 
      First-quarter Earnings per diluted share of $2.72 included an after-tax net gain of $97 million for 
insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative action 
related to McKesson’s controlled substances monitoring program.

      First-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $2.77 compared to $3.31 a year ago, a 
decrease of 16%, driven by the impact of lower prescription volumes and primary care patient visits and 
the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company’s now separated investment in Change 
Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare”), partially offset by a lower share count.

      For the first quarter, McKesson used cash from operations of $1.1 billion, returned $74 million to 
shareholders via dividend payments, and invested $117 million internally, resulting in negative Free Cash 
Flow of $1.2 billion. 

U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment
   •  First-quarter revenues were $45.1 billion, up 2%, driven by market growth and higher volumes 
      from retail national account customers, partially offset by branded to generic conversions and 
      lower prescription volumes in the quarter.
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $608 million and operating margin was 1.35%. 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $589 million, down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower 
      prescription volumes, partially offset by growth in the specialty provider business. Adjusted 
      operating margin was 1.31%, down 5 basis points.

European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment
   •  First-quarter revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% on an FX-
      Adjusted basis, primarily driven by lower volumes in the pharmaceutical distribution business.
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($10) million and operating margin was (0.16%), and 
      included restructuring charges related to our business in the U.K. Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $35 million, flat on a reported basis. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $36 million, up 3%, driven by lower operating expenses, partially offset by 
      lower volumes in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy businesses. On both a 
      reported and FX-Adjusted basis, adjusted operating margin was 0.56%, up 4 basis points.

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment
   •  First-quarter revenues were $1.8 billion, down 5%, driven by declines in primary care patient 
      visits, partially offset by higher volumes of personal protective equipment.
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $89 million and operating margin was 4.94%. Adjusted 
      Segment Operating Profit was $124 million, down 22%, driven by declines in primary care patient 
      visits. Adjusted operating margin was 6.89%, down from 8.36% in the prior year. 
Other remaining businesses
   •  First-quarter revenues were $2.6 billion, down 13% on a reported basis and down 10% on an FX-
      Adjusted basis, driven by lower pharmaceutical volumes in the Canadian business.
   •  First-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $98 million, down 30%. Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $137 million, down 50% on both a reported and FX-Adjusted basis, driven by the 
      lapping of the prior year contribution of $108 million from the company’s investment in Change 
      Healthcare and the negative impact of lower prescription volume trends within the Canadian and 
      MRxTS businesses.

Company Updates
   •  On July 29, 2020, McKesson’s Board of Directors declared an increase in the regular quarterly 
      dividend to 42 cents per share of common stock, demonstrating McKesson’s commitment to

      initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and Disability:IN.

      McKesson raised fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance to $14.70 to $15.50

expectations. McKesson continues to expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share growth in the second 
half of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare, 
Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, 
Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, Adjusted 
Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are 
financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP 
Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and 
usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for 
reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly 
comparable GAAP financial measures.

      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is 
unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most 
directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson 
cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially.

Cautionary Statements
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute 
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as 
financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent 
required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, 
“anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the 
negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, 
plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors 
to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal 
disputes, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might record significant charges from impairment to 
goodwill, intangibles and other assets or investments; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy 
profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract 
non-renewal; our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we 
might be harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely 
impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be 
adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may 
experience difficulties in sourcing products due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply 
chains; we might be adversely impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we 
might be adversely impacted by an economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from 
the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede 
our access credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and 
suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might 
be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues 
(including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political 
events and other catastrophic events.

                       SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by 
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•  Adjusted Gross Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Gross Profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding transaction-
   related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal 
   settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments.

•  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Operating  Expenses  as  GAAP  total  operating

   amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, and other adjustments.

•  Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Equity Income from Change 
   Healthcare  as  GAAP  equity  earnings  and  charges  from  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture,  excluding

   We completed the separation from our investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture during the fourth quarter of 
   fiscal 2020. 

•  Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Income

   expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 
   impairment  and  related  charges,  and  other  adjustments.  Income  tax  effects  are  calculated  in  accordance  with

   Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

•  Adjusted  Earnings  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Earnings  as  GAAP  income  from  continuing  operations 
   attributable to McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and 
   adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and

•  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share  as  GAAP 
   earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, excluding per share impacts 
   of  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-
   related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment  and  related  charges,  other 
   adjustments  as  well  as  the  related  income  tax  effects  for  each  of  these  items,  as  applicable,  divided  by  diluted 
   weighted-average shares outstanding. Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was not previously adjusted for the effect 
   of potentially dilutive securities issued by the Change Healthcare Joint Venture.

•  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  as  GAAP 
   segment operating profit, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and 
   adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and 
   related charges, and other adjustments.

                                                                                                  2 of 3


                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Adjusted Operating Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Operating Profit as GAAP income from continuing 
   operations  before  interest  expense  and  income  taxes,  excluding  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles, 
   transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal 
   settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments. 

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees,  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses 
   and settlements; other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/
   or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

   Additionally,  the  Company's  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture's  financial  results  are  adjusted  for  the 
   above noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted 
   results per diluted share. 
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when 
allocating  resources,  deploying  capital  and  assessing  business  performance  and  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
