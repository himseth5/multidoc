      Full-year GAAP and Adjusted Earnings include pre-tax charges totaling 
$229 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, related to the company’s cost 
alignment plan as disclosed in March 2016 (the “Cost Alignment Plan”). Full-year 
GAAP and Adjusted Earnings also include pre-tax gains of $103 million, or 29 
cents per diluted share, related to the sale of two businesses earlier in Fiscal 
2016. Excluding the Cost Alignment Plan charges and the gains on the sale of 
two businesses from Adjusted Earnings, full-year results per diluted share was 
$12.52, up 14% on a constant currency basis, year-over-year.  
      “I am pleased with our fourth-quarter results, driven by solid execution 
across both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments,” said 
John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. “Fiscal 2016 was a 
year of growth at McKesson, and I am encouraged by the many new and 
expanded customer relationships throughout our businesses. McKesson’s focus 
on driving value and innovation in our daily interactions with our customers, built 
on a deep foundation of operational excellence, will continue to propel our 
company going forward as we look to Fiscal 2017 and beyond.” 
      For the full year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $3.7 
billion, repaid approximately $1.6 billion in long-term debt and ended the year 
with cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion. During the year, McKesson had 
internal capital spending of $677 million, spent $40 million on acquisitions, 
repurchased approximately $1.5 billion of its common stock and paid $244 million 
in dividends. 
      “We delivered strong cash flow results for Fiscal 2016, which exceeded 
our original expectations,” Hammergren commented. “In Fiscal 2016, we 
executed across the full range of our portfolio approach to capital deployment, 
which included capital investments in support of growth of our businesses, more 
than $4.0 billion in announced acquisitions, which will contribute to McKesson’s 
growth in Fiscal 2017 and beyond, $1.5 billion in share repurchases, and $244 
million in dividends paid. I am exceptionally proud of our disciplined approach to 
capital deployment and our track record of creating long-term value for our 
shareholders.”

 Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $45.9 billion for the quarter, up 4% 
on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, 
Distribution Solutions revenues were $188.0 billion, up 7% on a reported basis 
and 9% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year.   
       North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were  
 $38.7 billion for the quarter, up 5% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant 
 currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth and growth from existing 
 customers. For the full year, North America pharmaceutical distribution and 
 services revenues were $158.5 billion, up 10% on a reported basis and 11% on a 
 constant currency basis, compared to the prior year.   
       International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $5.8 
 billion for the quarter, down 1% on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant 
 currency basis, driven by market growth. For the full year, International 
 pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $23.5 billion, down 11% 
 on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis, compared to the 
 prior year.  
       Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were up modestly for 
 the fourth quarter and full year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the 
 sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter.   
       Fourth-quarter Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $811 
 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.77%. On a constant currency basis, 
 fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $970 million and adjusted operating 
 margin was 2.09%. 
       For the full year, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $3.6 
 billion and GAAP operating margin was 1.89%. On a constant currency basis, 
 full-year adjusted operating profit was $4.4 billion, up 5% compared to the prior 
 year, and adjusted operating margin was 2.28%. Distribution Solutions fourth-
 quarter and full-year results include $161 million in pre-tax charges related to the 
 Cost Alignment Plan.  
       “Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year with good 
 performance within the segment. During Fiscal 2016, we expanded our global 


                                    3 
                                     
 pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement scale, grew our Health Mart franchise 
 to more than 4,600 members, delivered strong growth in our Specialty Health 
and Canadian businesses, and continued to successfully execute on our planned 
Celesio acquisition synergies,” said Hammergren.  
      Technology Solutions products and services revenues were down 5% for 
the fourth quarter and down 6% for the full year. Fourth-quarter and full-year 
Technology Solutions revenues were impacted by an anticipated year-over-year 
decline in our hospital software business and the sale of our nurse triage 
business in the first quarter. This revenue decline was partially offset by growth in 
our other technology businesses. 
      In the fourth quarter, GAAP operating profit was $93 million and GAAP 
operating margin was 12.67%. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $99 
million and adjusted operating margin was 13.45% on a constant currency basis.  
      For the full year, GAAP operating profit was $519 million and GAAP 
operating margin was 17.99%. For the full year, adjusted operating profit was 
$542 million and adjusted operating margin was 18.72% on a constant currency 
 basis. Technology Solutions fourth-quarter and full-year results include $51 
 million in pre-tax charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan.  
       “Our Technology Solutions segment had strong performance in Fiscal 
 2016. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress in shaping the 
 focus of our Technology Solutions portfolio and have delivered meaningful 
 improvements in our core, adjusted operating margin rate for the segment,” 
 added Hammergren. 
  
 Fiscal Year 2016 Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Earnings 
       Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.08 for the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2016 excludes the following GAAP items: 
    •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.27 per diluted 
       share;   
    •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 34 cents per diluted 
       share; and 
    •  LIFO inventory-related adjustments of 63 cents per diluted share. 


                                    4 
                                     
  
 Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook 
       For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, McKesson expects $13.30 to 
 $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes approximately 12 to 15 cents in 
 expected charges from Adjusted Earnings related to the Cost Alignment Plan.  
       “Our Fiscal 2017 outlook balances solid growth across our businesses and 
 growth from capital deployment, with the negative impact from customer 
 consolidation and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States,” 
concluded Hammergren.  
 
Key Assumptions for Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook 
      The Fiscal 2017 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and is 
also subject to the Risk Factors outlined below: 
   •  Distribution Solutions revenue growth is expected to increase by high-
      single digits driven by market growth and acquisitions.   
   •  We expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services to 
      deliver high-single digit revenue growth in Fiscal 2017. 
   •  International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues are 
      anticipated to grow low-double digits on a constant currency basis in 
      Fiscal 2017. 
   •  Medical-Surgical distribution and services is expected to deliver mid-single 
      digit revenue growth in Fiscal 2017.  
   •  Technology Solutions revenues are expected to be down slightly year-
      over-year driven by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software 
      business. 
   •  Fiscal 2017 branded pharmaceutical price trends in the U.S. market are 
      expected to be modestly below those experienced in Fiscal 2016.   
   •  We expect a nominal contribution to our Fiscal 2017 results from generic 
      pharmaceuticals that increase in price.  
   •  We expect the profit contribution from the launch of new oral generic 
      pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market to decrease year-over-year.  


                                    5 
                                 
•  Proceeds from anticipated antitrust litigation settlements are estimated to 
   be $140 million, pre-tax, for Fiscal 2017, compared to $76 million, pre-tax, 
   in Fiscal 2016. 
•  Fiscal 2017 pre-tax charges associated with our Cost Alignment Plan are 
   expected to be between $40 million and $50 million and are excluded from 
   our Fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share. 
•  The guidance range assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate of 
   approximately 31.0%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.  
•  Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures are expected 
   to be between $700 million and $800 million.  
•  We assume that our ownership position in Celesio will be approximately 
   76% for Fiscal 2017. 
•  We expect the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements will 
   have a net unfavorable impact of approximately 3 cents per diluted share 
   year-over-year as modest improvements in the Euro / USD average rate 
   will be more than offset by the GBP / Euro average rate when compared 
   to the prior year.  
•  Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per 
   share are expected to be approximately 228 million for the year. 
•  Cash flow from operations is expected to increase approximately 15% 
   year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments 
   expected in Fiscal 2017 related to the Cost Alignment Plan and a 
   settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and 
   the U.S. Department of Justice as disclosed in April 2015. 
•  Based on acquisitions announced as of March 31, 2016: 

      o  We expect amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of 
         approximately $1.36 per diluted share;   

      o  We expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 30 
         cents per diluted share; and 

      o  We expect LIFO inventory-related charges of 48 cents per diluted 
         share. 


                                6 
                                     
    •  The Fiscal 2017 guidance range does not include the impact of any 
       potential new acquisitions or divestitures, impairments or incremental 
       material restructuring charges, or any potential claim or litigation reserve 
       adjustments beyond those disclosed in the Form 8-K as filed on March 18, 
      2016.  
 
Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
 income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim 
 and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting changes to the company’s reserves 
 for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation 
 matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A 
 reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is 
 provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with 
 this release. 
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis.  
The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
 currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
      acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and 
      Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition 
      of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with 
      business acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions by 
      the Company.  Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention 
      payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-
      closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable 
      losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in 
      the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

      LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.

                                Euro to U.S. Dollar Average Foreign Exchange Rates by Quarter
Our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business reflects the results from Celesio AG ("Celesio"). Celesio independently 
reports its financial results in Euros. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, as provided on a constant currency basis,
