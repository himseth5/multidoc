      “Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, we are well positioned to leverage the differentiated assets and 
capabilities across McKesson to execute on our strategies, drive sustainable growth and create value for all 
stakeholders,” said Mr. Tyler. “We continue to invest for the long term, and our leadership positions, execution, 
and confidence in the future support our updated long-term segment growth targets.”  
       
      Fourth-quarter revenues were $68.9 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago, and full-year revenues 
were $276.7 billion, an increase of 5%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, partially 
offset by lower revenues in the International segment as a result of the completed divestitures of McKesson’s 
European businesses.  
       
      Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $5.71 compared to $2.48 a 
year ago, an increase of $3.23. Full-year earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $25.05 
compared to $7.26 a year ago, an increase of $17.79. 
 
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $7.19 compared to $5.83 a year ago, an 
increase of 23%, driven by lower tax rate, lower share count, and growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and 
Prescription Technology Solutions segments. Full-year Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $25.94 
compared to $23.69 a year ago, an increase of 9%, driven by a lower share count and growth in the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical segment, partially offset by lower contributions in the International segment as a result of the 
completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses.  
 
      For the full-year, McKesson returned $3.9 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.6 billion of 
common stock repurchases and $292 million of dividend payments. During the fiscal year, McKesson 
generated cash from operations of $5.2 billion, and invested $558 million in capital expenditures, resulting in 
Free Cash Flow of $4.6 billion.

  Fourth-Quarter 
   •  Revenues were $61.7 billion, an increase of 15%, driven by increased volume of specialty products,

      branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $764 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $861 million, an

  Fourth-Quarter

      driven by the divestitures of McKesson's European businesses. 
   •  Segment Operating Profit was $43 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating

  Full-Year

Fiscal 2024 Outlook 
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as the Company is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO 
inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and 
related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any 
associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
 
      McKesson anticipates Fiscal 2024 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share of $26.10 to $26.90, which 
reflects expected growth at or above updated long-term segment targets, execution against strategic growth 
opportunities, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, delivering sustainable long-term earnings 
growth.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
                                              
        

Raising Long-Term Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Growth Targets 
      McKesson continues to strengthen its portfolio of differentiated assets and capabilities to advance 
healthcare for all. As COVID-19 related contracts with the U.S. government are scheduled to end in July 2023, 
and the contribution from Europe continues to run off as guided, McKesson remains committed to its company 
priorities: 
   •  Focus on people and culture to achieve the company’s mission of improving care in every setting – one 
      product, one partner, one patient at a time. 
   •  Accelerate the expansion of McKesson’s differentiated oncology and biopharma services platforms. 
   •  Drive sustainable core growth through the strong value proposition of McKesson’s scaled and durable 
      distribution business. 
   •  Evolve and grow the portfolio through the continued exit of Europe, as we explore strategic alternatives 
      to exit its remaining operations in Norway.  
 
   As a result of strong execution against our strategic initiatives, operating momentum, and building on our 
differentiated assets and capabilities, McKesson is well positioned for strong growth in the years ahead and is 
raising long-term Adjusted Segment Operating Profit growth targets as follows: 
       
                                        Updated Long-Term        Previous Long-Term 
                                     Segment Growth Targets1   Segment Growth Targets1 

   U.S. Pharmaceutical                   5% to 7% growth              4% growth 

   Prescription Technology Solutions     11% to 12% growth            11% growth 

   Medical-Surgical Solutions           10% to 12% growth            10% growth 

   1 Base year metrics of Adjusted Segment Operating Profit exclude the impacts attributable to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution in U.S. Pharmaceutical and impacts 
   attributable to kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies and COVID-19 tests in Medical-Surgical Solutions 

      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable 
forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO 
inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, impairment and 
related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently 
uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any

      •  a pre-tax charge of $27 million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims with the 
         State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties; and
      •  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $47  million  ($39  million  after-tax)  related  to  our  estimated  liability  for  a  comprehensive 
         proposed  agreement  to  settle  opioid-related  claims  of  participating  states,  their  political  subdivisions,  and  other 
         governmental entities.
     These charges are included within Corporate expenses, net and under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of 
     McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying 
     financial statement tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2023 includes a pre-tax gain of $97 million ($72 million after-tax)  
     from termination of forward-starting fixed interest rate swaps. Management believes that this gain is not part of normal 
     business  operations  and  is  therefore  excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  This  gain  is  included  within 
     Corporate expenses, net and under "other income, net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
     adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(11) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 million after-
     tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-Surgical Solutions. 
     These charges were driven by the intent of management to not sell this excess inventory which required inventory write 
     downs to zero net realizable value, and instead direct it to charitable organizations or otherwise dispose. A portion of this 
     inventory was committed for donation and delivered to charitable organizations during fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of 
     this inventory which is no longer intended for sale in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge 
     is not part of normal business operations and is therefore excluded from our determination of adjusted results. A pre-tax 
     charge of $147 million ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, 
     which  we  no  longer  planned  to  sell,  and  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $8  million  ($6  million  after-tax)  is  included  under  "total 
     operating  expenses"  related  to  the  completed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to 
     adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(12) Other adjustments, net for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million ($141 million after-tax) 
     on debt extinguishment within Corporate expenses, net related to our July 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our 
     existing debt. This charge is included under "loss on debt extinguishment" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
     operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(13) Net losses (gains) associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 
     included pre-tax net losses of $36 million ($27 million after-tax) and pre-tax net gains of $98 million ($72 million after-
     tax),  respectively,  within  Corporate  expenses,  net.  These  amounts  were  recorded  under  “Other  income,  net”  in  the 
     Condensed  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  (GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  1  of  the  accompanying  financial 
     statement tables.
                                                                                                      3 of 3

                               FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(14) Termination of Tax Receivable Agreement ("TRA") with Change Healthcare for the year ended March 31, 2023 consists 
     of  a  pre-tax  gain  of  $126  million  ($93  million  after-tax)  within  Corporate  expenses,  net,  related  to  a  cash  payment 
     received as a result of the exercise of an option by Change Healthcare Inc. ("Change") pursuant to the TRA for early 
     termination of the agreement. We entered into this agreement as part of the formation of a joint venture with Change, from 
     which McKesson has since exited. This amount was recorded under “Other income, net” in the Condensed Consolidated 
     Statements of Operations (GAAP) provided in Schedule 1 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                      1 of 3

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In  an  effort  to  provide  investors  with  additional  information  regarding  the  Company's  financial  results  as  determined  by 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP"),  McKesson  Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "we")  also  presents  the

    related  expenses  and  adjustments,  last-in,  first-out  (“LIFO”)  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal 
    settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments.

    hedge  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  notes  resulting  from  changes  in 
    benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency-denominated notes were previously 
    designated  as  non-derivative  net  investment  hedges  of  portions  of  the  Company's  net  investments  in  its  now-divested 
    European businesses against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the 
    U.S. dollar.

    related charges, claims and litigation charges, and other adjustments. Income tax effects are calculated in accordance with

    Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and 
    related charges, claims and litigation charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these 
    items, as applicable.

    amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related 
    adjustments,  gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and  litigation

                                                                                                      2 of 3

                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    The  following  provides  further  details  regarding  certain  adjustments  made  to  our  Adjusted  Earnings  per  Diluted  Share 
    (Non-GAAP) financial results to arrive at our Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share Excluding Certain Items (Non-GAAP) 
    as defined above:

    U.S.  government's  COVID-19  vaccine  distribution  program  -  The  Company  distributes  certain  COVID-19  vaccines  in 
    support of the U.S. government through a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results of 
    operations related to this vaccine distribution program are reflected in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.

    U.S.  government's  kitting,  storage,  and  distribution  of  ancillary  supplies  program  and  COVID-19  tests  -  The  Company 
    operates under a contract to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of ancillary supply kits for COVID-19 vaccines 
    as directed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Sales of COVID-19 tests are also included in the Company's 
    results of operations. These items are reflected in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.

•   Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP)  and  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  (Non-GAAP): 
    We  define  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  as  GAAP  segment  operating  profit  (loss),  excluding  amortization  of 
    acquisition-related  intangibles,  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  LIFO  inventory-related  adjustments,  gains 
    from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, and other adjustments. We define Adjusted 
    Segment  Operating  Profit  Margin  as  Adjusted  Segment  Operating  Profit  (Non-GAAP)  divided  by  GAAP  segment 
    revenues.

•   Adjusted Corporate Expenses (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Corporate Expenses as GAAP corporate expenses, net, 
    excluding  transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments,  restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges,  claims  and 
    litigation charges, and other adjustments.

    The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our Non-
    GAAP measures as defined above:

    Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  -  Amortization  expenses  of  intangible  assets  directly  related  to  business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  -  Transaction,  integration,  and  other  expenses  that  are  directly  related  to 
    business  combinations,  the  formation  of  joint  ventures,  divestitures,  and  other  transaction-related  costs  including  initial

    losses on business combinations, and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash charges or credit adjustments.

    Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
    settlements.
                                                                                                      3 of 3

                   SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    Restructuring, impairment, and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change 
    our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted 
    as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure 
    or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, 
    and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product 
    line,  reorganization  or  management  structure  changes,  headcount  rationalization,  realignment  of  operations  or  products, 
    integration  of  acquired  businesses,  and/or  company-wide  cost  saving  initiatives.  The  amount  and/or  frequency  of  these 
    restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. 
    Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from adjusted results.

    Claims  and  litigation  charges  -  Adjustments  to  certain  of  the  Company’s  reserves,  including  those  related  to  estimated 
    probable  settlements  for  its  controlled  substance  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  opioid-related  claims,  as  well  as  any 
    applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees 
    to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred. This also may include charges or credits for general non-operational 
    claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on 
    an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not all-
    inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other 
    similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

    The  Company  evaluates  the  aforementioned  Non-GAAP  measures  on  a  periodic  basis  and  updates  the  definitions  from 
    time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Non-
    GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is provided 
    in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on an 
    FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our 
    operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
    currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share on an FX-
    Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and 
    adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the 
    Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
    tables included with this release.

•   Free  Cash  Flow  (Non-GAAP):  We  define  free  cash  flow  as  net  cash  provided  by  (used  in)  operating  activities  less 
    payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
    consolidated statements of cash flows. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Free Cash Flow (Non-
    GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with 
regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s 
future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability 
to  compare  its  financial  results  to  those  of  other  companies  in  the  same  industry.  However,  the  Company's  Non-GAAP 
measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Management utilizes Non-GAAP financial measures when allocating resources, deploying capital, as well 
as assessing business performance, and determining employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pound sterling. As a result, the comparability 
of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information  to  provide  a  framework  for  assessing  how  our  business  performed  excluding  the  estimated  effect  of  foreign 
currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  We  believe  free  cash  flow  is  important  to  management  and  useful  to  investors  as  a 
supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic 
acquisitions,  dividend  payments,  or  other  strategic  uses  of  cash.  Nonetheless,  Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-
GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a  substitute  for,  nor  superior  to,  financial  results  and 
measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
