•  Revenues of $47.9 billion for the third quarter, up 3%.  
•  Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of 
   $2.71, up 33%.  
•  Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.18, up 9%.  
•  Fiscal 2016 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. 
 
      SAN FRANCISCO, January 27, 2016 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 
31, 2015 were $47.9 billion, up 3% compared to $46.5 billion a year ago. On a 
constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% over the prior year. On the 
basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter 
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.71 compared to 
$2.04 a year ago.  
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.18, up 9% on a 
reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. 
Third-quarter results benefited from a lower tax rate driven by our mix of income 
and favorable discrete tax items primarily associated with recent legislative 
changes.  
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash 
from operations of $566 million, and ended the quarter with cash and cash 
equivalents of $3.4 billion. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, 
McKesson repurchased approximately $850 million of its common stock, repaid 
nearly $1 billion in long-term debt, had internal capital spending of $417 million 
and paid $179 million in dividends. 
      “Our outlook for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 remains the same as what 
we provided on January 11, 2016,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and 
chief executive officer. “Our third-quarter results were in line with our 
expectations and I am pleased with the excellent progress we have made in 
expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale, delivering operating margin

improvements in the Technology Solutions segment, and successfully executing 
on the Celesio acquisition synergies. As we enter the final months of Fiscal 2016 
and look to the future, I remain confident in our industry and the role we play in 
making the business of healthcare more efficient. It is McKesson’s unwavering 
focus on innovation and on serving our customers that has propelled us to be 
leaders in the markets we serve. And the McKesson team is the best in the 
business which gives me great confidence in our future,” concluded 
Hammergren. 
       
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $47.2 billion for the quarter, up 3% 
on a reported basis and up 6% on a constant currency basis.   
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were 
$39.6 billion for the quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant 
currency basis, primarily driven by market growth.  
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 
billion for the quarter, down 11% on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant 
currency basis, primarily driven by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway 
during Fiscal 2015, partially offset by continued growth in the United Kingdom.  
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were flat year-over-
year, primarily driven by the completed sale of the ZEE Medical business in the 
second quarter.  
      Third-quarter Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $906 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.92%. Third-quarter adjusted operating 
profit was $1.1 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant currency 
basis.  Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 
2.24% on a reported basis and 2.23% on a constant currency basis.  
      Technology Solutions revenues were $694 million, down 8% in the third 
quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the completed sale of the 
nurse triage business in the first quarter and by the anticipated year-over-year 
decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other 
technology businesses.

       Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $122 million for the third 
 quarter and GAAP operating margin was 17.58%. Adjusted operating profit was 
 $133 million for the third quarter and adjusted operating margin was 19.16% on a 
 reported basis and 18.22% on a constant currency basis.   
  
 Fiscal Year 2016 Outlook and Preliminary Fiscal 2017 Outlook 
       McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share between $12.60 
 and $12.90 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, based on an exchange 
 rate of $1.10 per Euro and excluding the following GAAP items: 
    •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.27 per diluted 
       share.  
    •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 31 cents per diluted 
       share. 
    •  LIFO inventory-related charges of 72 cents to 82 cents per diluted share. 
        
       The Fiscal 2016 guidance range does not include any potential claim or 
 litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
 divestitures, and impairments or material restructurings.  
  
       McKesson expects growth in Adjusted Earnings per diluted share for 
Fiscal 2017 to be between 3% and 8%, as reported, and between 7% and 12%, 
excluding 48 cents of gains on the disposition of two businesses and favorable 
discrete tax items in Fiscal 2016.  
 
Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim 
 and litigation reserve adjustments reflecting changes to the company’s reserves 
 for controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation 
 matters, and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A

 reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is 
 provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with 
 this release. 
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a Constant Currency 
 basis.  The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.  As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates.  Constant Currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how its business performed excluding the effect of 
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental Constant 
 Currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                  SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
core operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
      acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and 
      Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition 
      of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with 
      business acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions by 
      the Company.  Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention 
      payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-
      closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable 
      losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in 
      the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.

      LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
