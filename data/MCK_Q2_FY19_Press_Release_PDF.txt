•  Revenues of $53.1 billion for the second quarter, up 2% year over year. 
•  Second-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 
   of $2.51.  
•  Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.60, up 10% year 
   over year. 
•  Fiscal 2019 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $13.20 to $13.80 per diluted share. 
•  Previously announced multi-year strategic growth initiative operating model 
   optimization anticipated to drive approximately $300 million to $400 million in 
   annual savings by end of Fiscal 2021. 
 
      SAN FRANCISCO, October 25, 2018 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the second quarter ended 
September 30, 2018, were $53.1 billion, up 2% compared to $52.1 billion a year 
ago, and also up 2% on a constant currency basis. On the basis of U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), second-quarter earnings per diluted 
share from continuing operations was $2.51, compared to earnings per diluted 
share of $0.01 a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share included a pre-tax 
benefit of $90 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, related to a reversal of a 
contractual liability associated with McKesson’s equity investment in Change 
Healthcare. Prior year GAAP earnings per diluted share included $2.60 per 
diluted share of non-cash goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment 
charges, and restructuring charges. 
      Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.60, up 10% 
compared to $3.28 a year ago, primarily driven by a lower tax rate, including a 
discrete tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, and the 
aforementioned reversal of a contractual liability, partially offset by the previously 
announced customer losses in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, incremental 
challenges in our businesses in the U.K. and France, and increased litigation 
expenses related to opioids. 


                                   1 
      “While our operational performance reflects anticipated challenges coming 
into the fiscal year, our second quarter results were primarily affected by the 
incremental headwinds we are facing in the U.K. and French markets, driving 
underperformance versus our expectations. We continue to have conversations 
with the U.K. government to discuss the patient-care services that pharmacies 
provide and how this low-cost setting of care is vital to the healthcare system, 
while also working to accelerate efficiency and growth opportunities across all of 
our businesses,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive 
officer.  
      For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from 
operations of $318 million, and invested $248 million internally, resulting in free 
cash flow of $70 million, which was ahead of the company’s expectations. During 
the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson also paid $840 million for acquisitions, 
repurchased $877 million of its common stock, paid $139 million in dividends and 
the company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion. 
      “We are pleased with the contribution of our recent acquisitions, including 
MSD and RxCrossroads, which aligns with our stated multi-year strategic growth 
initiative. And we also continue to return capital to our shareholders through 
share repurchases and dividends,” concluded Hammergren. 
 
Multi-Year Strategic Growth Initiative Update 
      As previously announced on April 25, 2018, McKesson launched a multi-
year strategic growth initiative, inclusive of plans to optimize the company’s 
operating and cost structures. The company expects these cost actions will 
strengthen McKesson’s ability to focus resources, reduce complexity and 
improve efficiency and cost-competitiveness, enhancing and optimizing 
operations. McKesson expects these initiatives and actions will generate 
approximately $300 million to $400 million in annual pre-tax gross savings that 
will be substantially realized by the end of Fiscal 2021. 
      “We’ve prioritized growth opportunities, which include our manufacturer 
value proposition, services to support specialty pharmaceuticals and the future of 
retail pharmacy, all supported by data and analytics. Our cost reductions and 


                                   2 
operating model optimization will drive significant savings to support these 
priority growth areas,” said Brian S. Tyler, president and chief operating officer. 
“And as we move forward, the savings generated will make McKesson a more 
streamlined and efficient operation, complementing our investments and 
improving operating profit growth for the organization.”  
 
Segment Results 
      U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues were $41.6 billion 
for the quarter, up 2%, driven primarily by market growth and acquisitions, 
partially offset by previously announced customer losses and branded to generic 
conversions. Segment GAAP operating profit was $610 million and GAAP 
operating margin was 1.47%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $635 million 
and adjusted operating margin was 1.53%.  
      European Pharmaceutical Solutions revenues were $6.6 billion for the 
quarter, down 2% on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency 
basis, driven primarily by the previously disclosed reduction in owned retail 
pharmacies and a challenging operating environment in the U.K. and increased 
competition in France versus the prior year, partially offset by market growth in 
other countries. Segment GAAP operating profit was $10 million and GAAP 
operating margin was 0.15%. Segment adjusted operating profit was $53 million 
and adjusted operating margin was 0.80%. On a constant currency basis, 
adjusted operating profit was $54 million and adjusted operating margin was 
0.81%. 
      Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 
17%, driven primarily by an acquisition and market growth. Segment GAAP 
operating profit was $105 million and GAAP operating margin was 5.39%. 
Segment adjusted operating profit was $138 million and adjusted operating 
margin was 7.08%. 
      Revenues included in Other were $2.9 billion for the quarter, down 5% on 
a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by 
the prior year sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business, partially 
offset by market growth and acquisitions. Other GAAP operating profit was $95 


                                   3 
million and adjusted operating profit was $300 million. On a constant currency 
basis, adjusted operating profit was $310 million. 
       
Fiscal Year 2019 Outlook  
      McKesson now expects Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $13.20 to 
$13.80 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, from the previous range of 
$13.00 to $13.80 per diluted share.  
      McKesson does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis 
as the company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-
looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking 
GAAP measure without unreasonable effort, as items are inherently uncertain 
and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control. 
 
Dividend Declaration

of thirty-nine cents per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable on

Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-
related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and 
asset impairment charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, 
gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment 
charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are 


                                   5 
beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its 
impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
       
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release. 
       
Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash 
flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less property 
acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined in the company’s 
condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

company’s retail expansion; and the company’s inability to keep existing retail 
store locations or open new retail locations in desirable places. The reader

as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by law, the 
company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions 
to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition and transaction related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out 
      (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, other 
      adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.

      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures, and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs.  Examples include 
      transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee 
      relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent 
      consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses 
      related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the 
      Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring and asset impairment charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we 
      change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
      well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation 
      costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. 
      The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management 
      structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The 
      amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of 
      reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from the Adjusted 
      Earnings. 
      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; other asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; certain 
      discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
      during the one year measurement period; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items 
      as deemed appropriate.
      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2
                                SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures 
disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated 
in accordance with GAAP.
