       SAN FRANCISCO, January 25, 2017 – McKesson Corporation 
 (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 
 31, 2016, were $50.1 billion, up 5% compared to $47.9 billion a year ago. On the 
 basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter 
 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.86, compared to 
 $2.71 a year ago. 
       Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings were $3.03 per diluted share. Third-
 quarter results included pre-tax charges totaling $4 million, or approximately two 
 cents per diluted share, related to the company’s cost alignment plan disclosed in 
 March 2016 (the “Cost Alignment Plan”). Third-quarter results primarily benefited 
 from a lower tax rate, partially offset by a softer pricing environment in our U.S. 
 Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions compared to the prior year.  
       For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash 
 from operations of $3.3 billion, and ended the quarter with cash and cash 
 equivalents of $2.4 billion. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, 
 McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2.0 billion of its 
 common stock, repaid approximately $390 million in long-term debt, invested 


                                    1 
$369 million internally and paid $192 million in dividends. And our expectation for 
full-year cash flow from operations remains consistent with our original guidance. 
      On January 24, 2017, McKesson entered into an agreement to acquire 
CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion, or $0.9 billion net of incremental 
cash tax benefits. The agreement also includes a maximum $0.3 billion of 
consideration contingent upon CoverMyMeds’ financial performance through the 
fiscal year ending 2019. CoverMyMeds is a privately-owned company 
headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, that provides electronic prior authorization 
solutions to pharmacies, providers, payers and pharmaceutical 
manufacturers. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, 
including regulatory review, and is expected to close in the first half of Fiscal 
2018. 
      “I am pleased with our strong cash flow generation and our ability to 
deploy capital in meaningful and productive ways, particularly strategic 
acquisitions and share repurchases,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and 
chief executive officer. “Our announced acquisition of CoverMyMeds supports 
McKesson’s commitment to provide a comprehensive set of services and 
solutions that drive value across the healthcare continuum and secure patients’ 
access to their prescribed drugs. McKesson continues to further enhance its 
diverse suite of pharmaceutical technology solutions to support the very best in 
patient care.”  
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% 
on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $41.7 
billion for the quarter were up 5% both on a reported and constant currency 
basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by 
branded to generic conversions. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.2 
billion for the quarter, up 3% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency 
basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth. 


                                   2 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.6 billion for 
the quarter, down 1% compared to the prior year both on a reported and constant 
currency basis.  
      In the third quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $813 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.64%. On a constant currency basis, 
third-quarter adjusted operating profit was $809 million, down 24% from the prior 
year, and adjusted operating margin was 1.62%.  
      Technology Solutions revenues of $0.7 billion were flat both on a reported 
and constant currency basis in the third quarter, primarily driven by an 
anticipated year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, offset by 
growth in our other technology businesses.  
      Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $132 million for the third 
quarter and GAAP operating margin was 19.02%. On a constant currency basis, 
adjusted operating profit was $168 million for the third quarter, up 26% from the 
prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 24.24%. 
      “Although we were unfavorably impacted in the third quarter by weaker 
branded pharmaceutical pricing than anticipated, we are updating our Fiscal 
2017 outlook to reflect McKesson’s lower full-year effective tax rate,” continued 
Hammergren. “As a result, we now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share 
from continuing operations of $12.60 to $12.90 for the fiscal year ending March 
31, 2017,” concluded Hammergren.  
 
Fiscal 2017 Outlook 
      McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share between $9.80 to 
$10.30 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Adjusted Earnings per diluted 
share excludes the following items: 
   •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.30 to $1.45 per 
      diluted share; 
   •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 65 cents to 75 cents per 
      diluted share; 
   •  LIFO inventory-related credits of 60 to 70 cents per diluted share; and 


                                   3 
    •  Claim and litigation reserve credits of one cent per diluted share for 
       average wholesale price litigation matters. 
        
       Excluding the second-quarter EIS goodwill impairment charge and an 
 anticipated 2 to 4 cents in expected Cost Alignment Plan charges from Adjusted 
 Earnings, McKesson expects $12.60 to $12.90 per diluted share for the fiscal 
 year ending March 31, 2017.  
        
       The Fiscal 2017 guidance ranges do not include any potential claim or 
 litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
 divestitures, or impairments and material restructurings beyond those previously 
 publicly disclosed. 
  
 Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
 income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and 
 litigation reserve adjustments reflecting the company’s reserves for controlled 
 substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation matters, and 
 Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
 The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 


                                    4 
 currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. 
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
      acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and 
      Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted 
      Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business 
      acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions 
      and the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange by the Company. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional 
      service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related 
      expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign 
      currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable 
      losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in 
      the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

      LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
