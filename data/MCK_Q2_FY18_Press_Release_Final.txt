      SAN FRANCISCO, October 26, 2017 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the second quarter ended 
September 30, 2017, were $52.1 billion, up 4% compared to $50.0 billion a 
year ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”), second-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing 
operations was $0.01, compared to $1.35 a year ago. During the quarter, 
McKesson initiated a number of strategic and operational actions within our 
U.K. retail pharmacy business in response to the previously discussed U.K. 
government reimbursement reductions. As a result, second-quarter GAAP 
earnings per diluted share included $2.41 of non-cash goodwill and other 
long-lived asset impairment charges and $0.19 of restructuring charges. 
      Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.28, up 
11% compared to $2.96 a year ago. Second-quarter results were driven by 
organic growth across multiple business units, including the company’s 
strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, a lower share count and 
incremental profit contribution from acquisitions. This growth more than offset 
the year-over-year lapping effect of the previously disclosed lower profit 
contribution from increased price competition in our independent pharmacy 
business in Fiscal 2017, and the impact of reduced reimbursement in the 
company’s U.K. retail pharmacy business.  


                                  1 
      For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from 
operations of $1.3 billion and ended the quarter with cash and cash 
equivalents of $2.6 billion. During the first half of the year, McKesson repaid 
$545 million in long-term debt, paid $1.9 billion for acquisitions, repurchased 
$650 million of its common stock, invested $255 million internally and paid 
$121 million in dividends. 
      In addition, immediately following the close of the second quarter, 
McKesson completed the sale to Allscripts of the company’s Enterprise 
Information Solutions (EIS) business within the Technology Solutions 
segment.  
      “As expected, we generated strong sequential results in the second 
quarter, and our solid year-to-date cash flow performance allowed us to 
deploy meaningful capital for acquisitions and share repurchases, delivering 
further value for our shareholders,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and 
chief executive officer. “Additionally, we took important actions during the 
quarter to better position our business in light of reimbursement pressures 
levied by the National Health Service across our retail pharmacy operations in 
the U.K.” 
       “We continue to focus on executing across our businesses and are 
reiterating our previous Fiscal 2018 Adjusted Earnings outlook of $11.80 to 
$12.50 per diluted share, as we work towards a strong finish to our Fiscal 
2018,” Hammergren concluded. 
       
McKesson Executive Management Update 
      Paul Julian, executive vice president and group president, Distribution 
Solutions, will retire at the close of the calendar year, following 21 years of 
dedicated service to McKesson. Among his many accomplishments, Julian 
helped McKesson regain its position as the largest North American 
pharmaceutical distributor during his tenure as president of McKesson 
Pharmaceutical. 
      “For more than two decades, Paul has been a tremendous asset to 
McKesson. He has helped the company become the healthcare leader that it 
is today, and has developed a deep bench of talented leaders who are ready 
to take the company forward. Paul’s dedication and tireless commitment to 


                                  2 
our customers, our people, and the industry set him apart. Paul and I have 
worked together for longer than just his time at McKesson. He has been a 
great business partner and friend, and I will miss him,” commented 
Hammergren.

Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as 
GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and

                                  4 
       
Constant Currency 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency 
basis. The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, 
including the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the 
comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected 
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency 
information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the 
company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant currency information 
of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) 
is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 
 
Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests 
      McKesson also provides adjusted operating profit margin excluding 
noncontrolling interests. The company has arrangements involving third-party 
noncontrolling interests. As a result, pre-tax results are affected by the portion 
of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted operating 
profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information is presented to 
provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed 
excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. 
The supplemental adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling 
interests information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement 
tables included with this release.

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) 
      inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, other adjustments as well as the related 
      income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis 
      and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s 
      presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided 
      in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.

      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  Examples include transaction closing 
      costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and  employee relocation expenses, 
      facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, 
      recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency 
      contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net 
      Asset Exchange.

      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for significant programs in which we change our 
      operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted. Such charges 
      may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset 
      impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented 
      due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
      realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring 
      charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments 
      due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded.

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses; and other similar substantive 
      and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2
                                SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.  

    • Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests (Non-GAAP): The Company has arrangements involving third-
      party noncontrolling interests. As a result, our pre-tax results are affected by the portion of pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling 
      interests. To provide additional useful information to investors, we present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling 
      interests for our Distribution Solutions segment. We believe such information provides a framework for assessing how our business 
      performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson. We calculate adjusted operating profit excluding 
      noncontrolling interests by removing pre-tax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from adjusted operating profit (Non-GAAP).  
      Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit excluding 
      noncontrolling interests with the applicable segment’s revenues. This information is supplemental to the Company’s GAAP financial 
      results and is provided in Schedule 3 of this document. 

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We present adjusted operating profit margin excluding 
noncontrolling interests to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of net income that is not 
attributable to McKesson. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered 
a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
