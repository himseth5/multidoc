         program and COVID-19 tests;

      “Our financial results for the second quarter demonstrate how the continued development of our 
strategy, operating execution, and talented teams are driving solid growth. This performance enables further 
investments in both our oncology and biopharma businesses, which are foundations for our ability to deliver 
long term shareholder value," said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. "McKesson continues to advance as a 
diversified healthcare services leader. Our expanding capabilities, combined with continued execution, give us 
the confidence in our outlook, and as a result, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2023 Adjusted Earnings 
per Diluted Share to $24.45 to $24.95." 
       
      Second-quarter revenues were $70.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by 
growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased specialty product volumes, including 
retail national account customers, and market growth, partially offset by lower revenues in the International 
segment as a result of the progress on the planned divestiture of McKesson's European business.  
 
      Second-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $6.46 compared to $1.71 a 
year ago, an increase of $4.75. 
 
      Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.06 compared to $6.15 a year ago, a 
decrease of 1%, driven by prior year net gains from McKesson Ventures' equity investments and lower 
contribution from the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs and 
COVID-19 tests, partially offset by a lower share count. Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
included pre-tax net losses of approximately $3 million associated with McKesson Ventures' equity 
investments, compared to pre-tax net gains of approximately $97 million in the second-quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 
      For the first six months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which 
included $1.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $139 million of dividend payments. During the first six 
months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $166 million, and invested $222 million 
in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $56 million. 
 
Business Highlights 
   •  McKesson signed an agreement in principle to extend its pharmaceutical distribution partnership with 
      CVS Health through June 2027. 
   •  McKesson continues to expand its differentiated oncology and biopharma businesses, further 
      demonstrating meaningful progress against its company priorities. 
         ◦  On October 31, 2022, McKesson and HCA Healthcare completed its transaction and formed a 
            joint venture combining McKesson's US Oncology Research and HCA Healthcare's Sarah 
            Cannon Research Institute to advance cancer care and increase access to oncology clinical 
            research. McKesson also acquired Genospace, a leading innovator in precision medicine and 
            clinical trial matching.   
         ◦  On November 1, 2022, McKesson closed the transaction of Rx Savings Solutions (RxSS), a 
            prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and 
            adherence solutions to health plans and employers. 
   •  McKesson progressed in its planned exit of business operations within the European region and has 
      completed divestitures in 11 of the 12 countries. After entering into an agreement in July 2021 to sell 
      certain McKesson Europe businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the 
      PHOENIX Group, McKesson closed the transaction on October 31, 2022. 
 

                                              
        
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $60.1 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by increased volume of 
      specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, and market 
      growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $896 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $756 million, an increase of 3%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and 
      health systems, partially offset by lower demand of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Excluding the 
      impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered Adjusted 
      Segment Operating Profit growth of 5%. 
    
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $1.0 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by growth in prescription volumes 
      in our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $120 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $141 million, a decrease of 2%, driven by higher operating expenses, resulting from increased 
      headcount associated with annual support of customer programs.  
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 9%, driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, 
      partially offset by growth in the primary care business. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $299 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $307 million, a decrease of 4%, driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially offset by organic 
      business performance. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions 
      segment delivered Adjusted Segment Operating Profit growth of 7%. 
  
International Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $6.2 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $6.9 billion, a 
      decrease of 25%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson's UK and Austrian businesses. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Loss was $37 million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $151 million, a decrease of 7%, driven by the divestitures of McKesson's UK and 
      Austrian businesses. 
 
Company Updates 
   •  Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a member of McKesson’s independent Directors, was recognized with the 
      Distinguished Alumna Award by the DirectWomen Organization for her leadership and contributions to 
      board service.  
   •  Brian Tyler signed the Disability:IN’s “CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion,” reaffirming McKesson’s 
      commitment to create an inclusive workplace for its employees.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP 
financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted 
Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted Income Tax 
Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit, 
Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, FX-
Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement 
tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached 
schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
       
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to 
provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably 
forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, restructuring, 
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s 
control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements  
      This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements 
may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” 
“seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans”,” estimates” or the negative of these words or other 
comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, trends, strategy, plans, assumptions, or 
intentions, and discussions about an agreement in principle, may also include forward-looking statements. 
Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial performance 
forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by law, we 
undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements 
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, 
anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, we 
encourage investors to read the risk factors described in our most recent annual and periodic report filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
       
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes and 
settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation or 
challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, 
intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and might 
experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience significant 
problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we 
might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our 
contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by 
changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by delays or other 
difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as changes in pricing 
and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions in product supply and 
we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the 

                                              
        
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russo-Ukrainian War on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access 
to credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we 
might be adversely impacted by monetary inflation or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might 
be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the 
effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events (such as the 
Russo-Ukrainian War) and other catastrophic events; we may be adversely affected by global climate change 
or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; the company might not achieve a definitive 
contract for an agreement in principle; and we face uncertainties and risks related to COVID-19 vaccination 
distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES


(1) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 includes pre-tax 
   gains of $23 million ($3 million after-tax) and $35 million (charge of $1 million after-tax), respectively, to remeasure 
   assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell related to an agreement to sell certain of our European

   will not be utilized in the future, and the effect of accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with 
   the disposal group are included within International. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in 
   the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of 
   the accompanying financial statement tables.

(3) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes a gain

   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

   September 30, 2021 pre-tax charges of $190 million ($153 million after-tax), primarily within Corporate expenses, net 
   and  International.  These  charges  are  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's 
   GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial 
   statement tables.

(6) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of

                                                                                                  2 of 2


                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Claims  and  litigation  charges,  net  for  the  six  months  ended  September  30,  2021  includes  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $27 
   million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims with the State of New York and 
   its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million 
   after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of 
   participating states, their political subdivisions, and other governmental entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These 
   charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(8) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million 
   ($141  million  after-tax)  on  debt  extinguishment  related  to  our  July  2021  tender  offer  to  redeem  a  portion  of  our 
   existing  debt,  within  Corporate  expenses,  net.  This  charge  is  included  under  "loss  on  debt  extinguishment"  in  the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

(9) Other adjustments, net for the six months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical  Solutions.  These  charges  are  driven  by  the  intent  of  management  to  not  sell  this  excess  inventory  which 
   required  inventory  write  downs  to  zero  net  realizable  value,  and  instead  direct  it  to  charitable  organizations  or 
   otherwise dispose. A portion of this inventory was committed for donation to charitable organizations during our first 
   quarter of fiscal 2022, which was delivered during fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this inventory which is no longer 
   intended for sale in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of normal business 
   operations  and  is  therefore  excluded  from  our  determination  of  adjusted  results.  A  pre-tax  charge  of  $147  million 
   ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which we no longer 
   plan  to  sell,  and  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $8  million  ($6  million  after-tax)  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses" 
   related  to  the  completed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees  to  defend  claims,  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  This  also  may  include  charges  or  credits  for  general  non-
   operational claims not directly related to our ongoing business.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3


                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
