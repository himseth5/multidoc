      IRVING, Texas, May 8, 2019 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2019, were 
$52.4 billion compared to $51.6 billion a year ago, an increase of 2% on a 
reported basis and an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. For the fiscal 
year, McKesson had revenues of $214.3 billion, compared to $208.4 billion a 
year ago, an increase of 3% on a reported and FX-adjusted basis.  
      “McKesson delivered solid adjusted operating results, and we are pleased 
to conclude fiscal 2019 with adjusted EPS growth of 8%,” said Brian Tyler, chief 
executive officer. “We successfully executed in a challenging environment and 
took action to address the headwinds in our European business. McKesson exits 
fiscal 2019 with improving momentum across many of our businesses. Our 
financial flexibility, reinforced by a strong balance sheet and solid cash flow 
generation, positions us to continue delivering shareholder value.” 


                                   1 
      On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), 
fourth-quarter loss per diluted share from continuing operations was $(4.17), 
compared to loss per diluted share of $(5.58) a year ago. Full-year GAAP 
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.17, compared to 
GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.30 a year ago. 
Fourth-quarter GAAP loss per diluted share and full-year GAAP earnings per 
diluted shared included after-tax net charges totaling approximately $1.5 billion 
and $2.2 billion, respectively, or $7.63 and $11.00 per diluted share, respectively, 
reflecting non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, as well as 
restructuring charges largely in the company’s European businesses.  
      Fourth-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.69, an 
increase of 6% compared to $3.49 a year ago, primarily driven by a lower share 
count and growth in the Medical-Surgical business, partially offset by weakness 
in the U.K. retail pharmacy business, including an inventory charge recorded in 
the fourth quarter, and a higher adjusted tax rate. Full-year Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share was $13.57, an increase of 8% compared to $12.62 for the prior 
year, primarily driven by a lower share count, growth in the McKesson 
Prescription Technology Solutions (MRxTS) and Medical-Surgical businesses 
and a lower adjusted tax rate, partially offset by lower profit contribution from the 
U.S. Pharmaceutical business related to the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 customer 
losses and weakness in the U.K. retail pharmacy business.
      For the full year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $4.0 
billion, and invested $557 million internally, resulting in free cash flow of $3.5 
billion. During the year, McKesson paid $905 million for acquisitions, 
repurchased approximately $1.6 billion of its common stock, and paid $292 
million in dividends. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash 
equivalents of $3.0 billion. 

U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment 
   •  Fourth Quarter: Revenues were $40.9 billion, up 3%, driven primarily by 
      market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions and 
      fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 customer losses. GAAP operating profit was 


                                   2
      $873 million and GAAP operating margin was 2.13%. Adjusted operating 
      profit was $752 million, down 1%, and adjusted operating margin was 
      1.84%.  
   •  Full Year: Revenues were $167.8 billion, up 3%, driven primarily by 
      market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by fourth-quarter fiscal

European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment 
   •  Fourth Quarter: Revenues were $6.8 billion, down 6% on a reported 
      basis and up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by market 
      growth, partially offset by the fiscal 2018 actions to sell or divest owned 
      retail pharmacies and a challenging market environment in the U.K. GAAP 
      operating loss was $(1.5) billion and GAAP operating margin was 
      (21.52)%. The segment recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 
      billion in the fourth quarter, mainly due to declines in estimated future cash 
      flows primarily attributed to the continued effects of U.K. government 
      reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the U.K. Adjusted 
      operating profit was $23 million, down 72%, and adjusted operating 
      margin was 0.34%. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit 
      was $26 million, down 68%, and adjusted operating margin was 0.36%. 
      The segment results include an inventory charge of approximately $20 
      million in the fourth quarter. 
   •  Full Year: Revenues were $27.2 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 
      1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by market growth, partially 
      offset by the fiscal 2018 reduction in owned retail pharmacies and a 
      challenging market environment in the U.K. and France. GAAP operating 
      loss was $(2.0) billion and GAAP operating margin was (7.26)%. The 
      segment GAAP results include full-year pre-tax restructuring charges of 
      $63 million as a result of actions taken to address performance in the 


                                   3
      segment. Adjusted operating profit was $219 million, down 36%, and 
      adjusted operating margin was 0.80%. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted 
      operating profit was $220 million, down 35%, and adjusted operating 
      margin was 0.80%.  

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Fourth Quarter: Revenues were $2.0 billion, up 13%, driven primarily by 
      an acquisition and growth in the Primary Care and Lab Solutions 
      businesses. GAAP operating profit was $121 million and GAAP operating 
      margin was 6.19%. Adjusted operating profit was $172 million, up 21%, 
      and adjusted operating margin was 8.80%.

and equity accounting method investment in Change Healthcare) 
   •  Fourth Quarter: Revenues were $2.8 billion, down 6% on a reported 
      basis and down 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by April 
      2018 government actions taken in Canada, partially offset by market 
      growth. GAAP operating profit was $111 million and adjusted operating 
      profit was $258 million, up 6%. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted 
      operating profit was $261 million, up 7%.  
   •  Full Year: Revenues were $11.7 billion, down 1% on a reported basis and 
      up 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven primarily by market growth, 
      partially offset by government actions enacted in Canada and the fiscal 
      2018 sale of the company’s Enterprise Information Solutions business. 
      GAAP operating profit was $394 million and adjusted operating profit was 
      $995 million, up 7%.  On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit

Company Updates 
   •  Renewed pharmaceutical distribution relationship with CVS Health 
      through June 2023. 
   •  McKesson relocated its global corporate headquarters from San 
      Francisco, California, to Irving, Texas, effective April 1, 2019.  
   •  Board of Directors elected Dominic Caruso and Brad Lerman as new 
      independent directors. 
   •  In January of 2019, the Board of Directors formed a Compliance 
      Committee to enhance oversight of the company’s compliance programs 
      and management’s identification and evaluation of the principal legal and 
      regulatory compliance risks. Brad Lerman, who has significant experience 
      leading global legal, government affairs, ethics and compliance functions, 
      chairs the committee. 
   •  Following McKesson’s announcement of a $100 million contribution to 
      create a non-profit foundation to address the opioid epidemic in March 
      2018, the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts (FORE) appointed Dr. 
      Andrea Barthwell as board chair and Dr. Karen A. Scott as president. 
   •  Enhanced leadership and executive teams: appointed Kirk Kaminsky 
      president of U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions business 
      effective April 15, 2019, and appointed Tracy Faber executive vice 
      president and chief human resources officer effective October 1, 2019, 
      following Jorge Figueredo’s announced retirement. 

Cost Savings Target Update 
      As a result of actions taken in the second half of fiscal 2019 to address 
challenges in the European business and to better position the U.S. and 
Canadian businesses, the company now anticipates it will generate 
approximately $400 million to $500 million in annual pre-tax savings that will be 
substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2021, an increase from the prior 
expectation of $300 million to $400 million as previously announced on October 
25, 2018.  


                                   5
      “We are making important progress towards our initiatives and are 
confident that the actions we are taking position us for growth in fiscal 2020 and 
beyond,” Tyler concluded. 

Fiscal 2020 Outlook and Key Assumptions 
      McKesson expects full-year fiscal 2020 Adjusted Earnings per diluted 
share of $13.85 to $14.45, which reflects solid growth across the company’s 
operating segments, a continuation of disciplined, efficient capital deployment, 
investments in the business, increased costs for opioids litigation and modest 
improvement in the U.K. business.
      The fiscal 2020 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and 
expectations, and is also subject to risk factors such as those described below: 
   •  McKesson to deliver low- to mid-single digit percent revenue growth and 
      flat to low-single digit percent adjusted income from operations decline in 
      fiscal 2020. 
   •  U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions to deliver low- to mid-single 
      digit percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2020. 
   •  European Pharmaceutical Solutions to deliver low- to mid-single digit 
      percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2020. 
   •  Medical-Surgical Solutions to deliver high-single digit percent revenue 
      growth and high-single to low double-digit percent adjusted operating 
      profit growth in fiscal 2020.  
   •  Other to deliver approximately flat to low-single digit percent revenue 
      decline and adjusted operating profit is expected to decline low- to mid-
      single digit percent in fiscal 2020, which assumes the company’s 
      continued 70% equity interest in Change Healthcare through March 31, 
      2020. 
   •  Adjusted corporate expenses to be between approximately $725 million 
      and $775 million, primarily driven by an anticipated increase in opioid-
      related litigation costs, and investments in technology-related 
      infrastructure and growth-oriented data and analytics capabilities. 
   •  Interest expense to be between $245 million and $265 million. 


                                   6
   •  The guidance range assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate of 
      approximately 18-19%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.  
   •  Foreign currency exchange rate movements to have a net neutral impact 
      to adjusted earnings per diluted share year over year.  
   •  Free cash flow to be $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion, which is net of expected 
      payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software 
      expenditures of between $500 million and $700 million. 
   •  Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per 
      share to be approximately 185 million for the year.

                                   7
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-
related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and 
asset impairment charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP 
basis prospectively as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative 
reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, 
because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, 
gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment 
charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are 
beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its 
impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 

FX-Adjusted 
      McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-adjusted basis, 
which is the same measure formerly designated Constant Currency. The 
company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the Euro, 
British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the financial 
results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. FX-adjusted information is presented to provide a framework for 
assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental FX-adjusted information 
of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is 
provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this 
release. 


                                   8
Free Cash Flow  
      McKesson also provides free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash 
flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for 
property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as outlined 
in the company’s condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

(a)   Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
(b)   Diluted net loss per share for the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, as reported under GAAP, is calculated using a weighted average of 191 million and 206 million common shares and excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to 
      their antidilutive effects. Potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the fiscal 2019 and 2018 GAAP per share computations due to our reported net loss for the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018. Diluted adjusted earnings (Non-GAAP) 
      per share, and GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items, are calculated using a weighted average of 192 million and 207 million common shares and include dilutive securities for the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018. Any cross-
      footing differences in per share amounts are due to a difference in weighted average shares outstanding in calculating GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net income. 
(c)   Adjusted Earnings per share on an FX-Adjusted basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was $3.71 per diluted share, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.02 per diluted share.

                                      SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press 
release.  The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to 
its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and 
calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition and transaction related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out 
      (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring and asset impairment charges, other 
      adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations 
      and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.
      Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      combinations, the formation of joint ventures, and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs.  Examples include 
      transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee 
      relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent 
      consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses 
      related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the 
      Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.
      LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

      Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

      Restructuring and asset impairment charges - Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we 
      change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
      well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation 
      costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. 
      The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management 
      structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The 
      amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of 
      reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from the Adjusted 
      Earnings. 

      Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual 
      basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments 
      may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of 
      assets; other asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; certain 
      discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; 
      gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

      Additionally, our equity method investments' financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.
                                                                                                                              2 of 2


                                  SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

    • FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, which is the same measure 
      formerly designated Constant Currency. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period 
      results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign 
      currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted 
      basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax 
      expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results 
      and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, 
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures 
disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated 
in accordance with GAAP.
