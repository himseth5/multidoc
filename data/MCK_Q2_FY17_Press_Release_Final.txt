•  Revenues of $50.0 billion for the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year. 
•  Second-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations 
   of $1.35, down 49% year-over-year.  
•  Excluding a goodwill impairment charge of $1.24 and Cost Alignment Plan 
   credits of 2 cents from Adjusted Earnings, second-quarter results per diluted 
   share of $2.94, down 7% year-over-year, compared to $3.17 in the prior year. 
•  Board of Directors authorized a new $4.0 billion share repurchase program. 
•  Revised Fiscal 2017 Outlook: GAAP earnings per diluted share from 
   continuing operations of $8.95 to $9.80. 
•  Revised Fiscal 2017 Outlook: $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which 
   excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 in charges to Adjusted Earnings 
   related to a goodwill impairment and the Cost Alignment Plan. 
 
      SAN FRANCISCO, October 27, 2016 – McKesson Corporation 
(NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the second quarter ended 
September 30, 2016, were $50.0 billion, up 2% compared to $48.8 billion a year 
ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), 
second-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.35, 
compared to $2.65 a year ago.  
      Second-quarter results included a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment 
charge of $290 million, or $1.24, related to our Enterprise Information Solutions 
(EIS) business within Technology Solutions, and pre-tax credits of $10 million, or 
2 cents, related to the company’s cost alignment plan as disclosed in March 2016 
(the “Cost Alignment Plan”). Excluding the goodwill impairment charge and the 
Cost Alignment Plan credits, second-quarter Adjusted Earnings were $2.94 per 
diluted share. Second-quarter results were impacted by a softer pricing 
environment in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions 
compared to previous expectations. Prior year second-quarter Adjusted 
Earnings, excluding a pre-tax gain of $52 million, or 14 cents, related to the sale 
of the ZEE Medical business within Distribution Solutions, was $3.17 per diluted 
share. 


                                   1 
      The company is updating its outlook from the previous range of $13.43 to 
$13.93 per diluted share to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share for 
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. This revised outlook excludes from 
Adjusted Earnings the second-quarter EIS goodwill impairment charge and 
anticipated Cost Alignment Plan charges of 6 to 8 cents per diluted share. 
      “Our updated outlook for Fiscal 2017 reflects McKesson’s expectation of a 
lower profit contribution resulting from recent customer pricing activities and 
lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical 
pricing trends compared to previous expectations,” said John H. Hammergren, 
chairman and chief executive officer. “While we work to actively respond to these 
market forces, we remain focused on our long-term strategy of innovation and 
value-added solutions. And though we responded quickly to maintain market 
share and mitigate these pricing challenges, we recognize the near-term impact 
requires a revision to our outlook.”  
      For the first half of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from 
operations of $2.9 billion and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents 
of $5.5 billion. During the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2.0 billion for 
acquisitions, $129 million in dividends and had internal capital spending of $240 
million. And our expectation for full-year cash flow from operations remains 
consistent with our original guidance. 
      “Despite the downward revision to our outlook, we believe in, and remain 
committed to, the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and 
manufacturer partners,” continued Hammergren. “McKesson has a great tradition 
of customer focus, operational excellence, robust capital deployment, strong 
management, disciplined execution, and long-term value creation. We remain as 
committed as ever to our value proposition,” concluded Hammergren. 
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.3 billion for the quarter, up 3% 
both on a reported and constant currency basis. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $41.4 
billion for the quarter were up 2% both on a reported and constant currency 


                                   2 
 basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a 
previously disclosed customer loss in the prior year. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.3 
billion for the quarter, up 7% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency 
 basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth. 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.6 billion for 
 the quarter, up 4%, primarily driven by market growth.  
       In the second quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was 
 $851 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.73%. Second-quarter adjusted 
 operating profit was $930 million, down 19% from the prior year on a reported 
 basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the 
 Distribution Solutions segment was 1.89% on a constant currency basis.  
       Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% both on a reported and 
 constant currency basis in the second quarter, primarily driven by an anticipated 
 year-over-year decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by 
 growth in our other technology businesses.  
       Technology Solutions GAAP operating loss was $174 million for the 
 second quarter and GAAP operating margin was (25.59%). On a constant 
 currency basis, adjusted operating loss was $143 million for the second quarter 
 and adjusted operating margin was (21.03%). Excluding the goodwill impairment 
 charge related to our EIS business and credits related to the company’s Cost 
 Alignment Plan, adjusted operating profit was $141 million for the second quarter 
 and adjusted operating margin was 20.74%. 
  
 Revised Fiscal 2017 Outlook 
       McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share between $8.95 to 
 $9.80 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Adjusted Earnings per diluted 
 share excludes the following items: 
    •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.25 to $1.35 per 
       diluted share; 
    •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of 50 cents to 65 cents per 
       diluted share; 


                                    3 
   •  LIFO inventory-related charges of up to 10 cents per diluted share; and 
   •  Claim and litigation reserve credits of 2 cents per diluted share for average 
      wholesale price litigation matters. 
       
      Excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge and an anticipated 6 to 8 
cents in expected Cost Alignment Plan charges from Adjusted Earnings, 
McKesson expects $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 2017. This revised expectation includes the following significant 
updates to the key assumptions we provided on July 27, 2016: 
   •  Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated 
      Cost Alignment Plan charges, expected to be approximately 30 to 40 
      basis points below the Fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin of 234 basis 
      points, primarily driven by increased competitive pricing activity.  
   •  Branded pharmaceutical price trends in the U.S. market are now expected 
      to be meaningfully below those experienced in Fiscal 2016. 
   •  Excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge, we now expect a full-year 
      adjusted tax rate of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter to 
      quarter. 
   •  Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per 
      share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. 
       
      The Fiscal 2017 guidance ranges do not include any potential claim or 
litigation reserve adjustments, or the impact of any potential new acquisitions and 
divestitures, or impairments and material restructurings beyond those previously 
publicly disclosed. 
 
Adjusted Earnings 
      McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and 
litigation reserve adjustments reflecting the company’s reserves for controlled 


                                   4 
 substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation matters, and 
Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of 
McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
  
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
 The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
 effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
 currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
 Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
 included with this release.

                                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results.  
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of 
      acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation reserve adjustments and 
      Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company evaluates its definition of 
      Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and 
      qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings.  A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.   

      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with business 
      acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions 
      and the proposed Healthcare Technology net asset exchange by the Company.  Examples include transaction closing costs, professional 
      service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related 
      expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign 
      currency contracts, and gains or losses on business combinations.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest, for estimated probable 
      losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are defined in 
      the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

      LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
