      “The dedication and execution of our teams continue to deliver outstanding results, responding to 
the evolving needs of our customers,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “Our strong second-quarter 
earnings results reflect the breadth of McKesson’s differentiated portfolio and further improvement in 
volumes across the business. At the same time, we continue to invest into the business to support our long-
term growth strategies. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 
2021 and now expect Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $16.00 to $16.50. With our steadfast 
commitment to our communities and those in need, we will continue to play a critical role in the fight against 
the global COVID-19 pandemic.”  
       
      Second-quarter revenues were $60.8 billion, up 6% from a year ago, driven by growth in the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to market growth and higher volumes from retail national account 
customers, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
 
      Second-quarter Earnings per diluted share of $3.54 included a GAAP-only pre- and post-tax 
goodwill impairment charge of $69 million recorded in connection with the segment realignment and a 
GAAP-only after-tax charge of $37 million for an estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid 
Stewardship Act. Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share does not include these charges. 
 
                         
      Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $4.80 compared to $3.60 a year ago, an 
increase of 33%, driven by a lower share count, a lower tax rate and growth in the Medical-Surgical 
Solutions segment, partially offset by the lapping of the prior year contribution from the company's now 
separated investment in Change Healthcare LLC ("Change Healthcare"). Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings 
per diluted share also includes pre-tax net gains of approximately $49 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, 
associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity investments. 
 
      For the first six months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $388 million of cash to shareholders 
via $248 million of common stock repurchases and $140 million of dividend payments. During the first six 
months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $41 million, and invested $265 million 
internally, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $306 million. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $48.1 billion, up 5%, driven by market growth and higher volumes 
      from retail national account customers, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $623 million and operating margin was 1.30%, and 
      included a GAAP-only pre-tax charge of $50 million for an estimated liability related to the New York 
      State Opioid Stewardship Act. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $658 million, up 3% from a 
      year ago, driven by growth in specialty, partially offset by higher operating expenses in support of 
      the company’s strategic growth initiatives. Adjusted operating margin was 1.37%, down 3 basis 
      points. 
 
International Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $9.5 billion, up 2% on a reported basis and down 1% on an FX-
      Adjusted basis, primarily driven by lower volumes in the Canadian pharmaceutical distribution 
      business due to the exit of an unprofitable customer at the onset of fiscal 2021, partially offset by 
      higher volumes in the European business. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($45) million and operating margin was (0.47%), 
      driven by a GAAP-only goodwill impairment charge of $69 million recorded in connection with the 
      segment realignment that commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted Segment 
      Operating Profit was $116 million, up 20%. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted Segment Operating 
      Profit was $115 million, up 19%, driven by lower operating expenses in the European business. 
      Adjusted operating margin was 1.22%, up 18 basis points. On an FX-Adjusted basis, adjusted 
      operating margin was 1.24%, up 20 basis points. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, up 23%, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests and 
      personal protective equipment in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $187 million and operating margin was 7.38%. 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $210 million, up 27%, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests 
      and organic growth in the segment. Adjusted operating margin was 8.29%, up 22 basis points. 
 
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $668 million, up 7%, driven by new brand support programs, partially 
      offset by the impact of lower prescription volume trends. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $88 million and operating margin was 13.17%. 
      Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $104 million, down 10%, driven by higher operating 
      expenses in support of the company’s strategic growth initiatives. Adjusted operating margin was 
      15.57%, down from 18.37% in the prior year. 
 
                         
Other remaining businesses 
   •  As a result of the segment realignment effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Other reflects 
      equity earnings and charges for retrospective periods for the company's previous investment in 
      Change Healthcare, which was separated from the company during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
      Operating loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 included GAAP-only pre-tax charges of 
      approximately $1.4 billion, primarily related to an impairment in connection with this planned exit.   
       
Company Updates 
   •  On August 14, 2020, McKesson announced the expansion of its existing partnership with the 
      Centers for Disease Control to support the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed team as a 
      centralized distributor of future COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer 
      vaccinations. McKesson will leverage the strength of its experience, expertise, and commitment to 
      health care delivery and access to make a difference in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
   •  Linda Mantia joined McKesson's Board of Directors as a new independent director effective  
      October 19, 2020. 
   •  On November 1, 2020, McKesson completed the contribution of its German wholesale business to a 
      joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). WBA holds a 70% controlling equity interest in 
      the joint venture and McKesson holds the remaining 30%. 
   •  McKesson was named to the Diversity Best Practices (DBP) fourth annual Inclusion Index.  
      McKesson was among the 98 organizations that earned a top score.  
 
Fiscal 2021 Outlook 
      McKesson raised fiscal 2021 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance to $16.00 to $16.50 from 
the previous range of $14.70 to $15.50 to reflect strong execution and earlier improvement in volumes 
relative to expectations through the first half of fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2021 guidance assumes approximately 
$0.15 to $0.20 of Adjusted Earnings per diluted share related to the kitting and storage of ancillary supplies 
for future COVID-19 vaccines. 
       
      Fiscal 2021 guidance assumes that a full recovery of pharmaceutical prescription volumes and 
patient visits is not likely to occur this fiscal year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Equity Income from Change Healthcare, 
Adjusted Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment 
Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted 
Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in 
accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the 
accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP 
financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-
GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, 
impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These 
items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s 
control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially. 
       
Cautionary Statements 
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute 
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as financial 
performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by 
law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, 
“will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words or 
other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions 
may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors to read the important risk factors 
described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
 
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes, 
including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might experience 
losses not covered by insurance; we might record significant charges from impairment to goodwill, 
intangibles and other assets or investments; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy profitability; we 
might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; our 
contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be harmed by 
changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare 
reform such as changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes 
or disruptions in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing 
products due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely impacted 
as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an economic 
slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession and by 
disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access credit, increase our borrowing costs 
and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events outside of our 
control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced from the 
COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; and we face 
uncertainties and risks related to vaccination distribution programs.

(a)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(b)  We calculate loss per diluted common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation (GAAP) for the three and six months 
     ended September 30, 2019 using a weighted average of 183 million and 185 million common shares, respectively, which excludes dilutive securities from 
     the denominator due to their antidilutive effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate adjusted earnings per diluted share (Non-
     GAAP) for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 184 million and 186 million common 
     shares, respectively. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any cross-footing differences in those 
     items are due to different weighted average share counts.
(c)  Adjusted earnings per diluted share on an FX-adjusted basis for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 was $4.80 and $7.58, respectively, 
     which does not result in a foreign currency exchange effect in either period.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(1) Amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles  includes  our  proportionate  share  of  loss  from  investment  in  Change 
   Healthcare Joint Venture within Other. Such amount includes the amortization of equity investment intangibles and 
   other acquired intangibles of $63 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and $140 million for the six 
   months ended September 30, 2019. These charges are included under "equity earnings and charges from investment in 
   Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted  results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(2) Transaction-related  expenses  and  adjustments  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  September  30,  2019  primarily 
   includes a pre-tax charge of $246 million ($184 million after-tax) within Other, representing the difference between 
   our  proportionate  share  of  the  IPO  proceeds  and  the  dilution  effect  on  our  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint 
   Venture carrying value. Upon the completion of the IPO by Change Healthcare Inc. in July 2019, McKesson's equity 
   ownership  interest  in  the  joint  venture  diluted  from  approximately  70%  to  58.5%.  This  charge  is  included  under 
   "equity  earnings  and  charges  from  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture" in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables. 

(3) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 includes 
   pre-tax charges of $60 million ($45 million after-tax) and $116 million ($90 million after-tax), respectively, primarily 
   for our Europe business within International and Corporate expenses, net. The three and six months ended September 
   30, 2019 includes charges of $45 million ($35 million after-tax) and $68 million ($52 million after-tax), respectively, 
   primarily for our Europe business within International as well as Corporate expenses, net. These charges are included 
   under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-
   GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement  tables.  Additionally,  restructuring, 
   impairment,  and  related  charges,  net  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  September  30,  2020  and  2019  includes 
   immaterial  amounts  under  “gross  profit”  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating  results  to  adjusted 
   results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. 

(4) Other adjustments, net for the six months ended September 30, 2020 primarily includes a pre-tax net gain of $131 
   million ($97 million after-tax) related to insurance proceeds received, net of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to 
   plaintiffs' counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our 
   controlled substances monitoring program within Corporate expenses, net. This gain is included under "total operating 
   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. 

(5) Other  adjustments,  net  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  September  30,  2019  primarily  includes  a  charge  of $82  
   million (pre-tax and after-tax) recorded in connection with an agreement to settle all opioids related claims filed by 
   two Ohio counties within Corporate expenses, net. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the 
   reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the 
   accompanying financial statement tables.

(6) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 primarily includes pre-tax charges of 
   $105  million  ($78  million  after-tax)  and  $122  million  ($90  million  after-tax),  respectively,  representing  settlement 
   charges related to our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan within Corporate expenses, net. This charge is included 
   under "other income (expense), net" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results 
   (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(7) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 primarily includes a pre-tax charge of 
   $1,157 million ($864 million after-tax) representing an other-than-temporary impairment of McKesson’s investment in 
   Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture  within  Other.  This  charge  is  included  under  “equity  earnings  and  charges  from 
   investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture”  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  operating  results  to 
   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  2 of 2

                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(8) Other  adjustments,  net  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  September  30,  2020  includes  a  non-cash  goodwill 
   impairment charge of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, 
   partially offset by the related indirect effect of $4 million benefit in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
   This  impairment  charge  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables.

(9) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 includes a pre-tax charge of $50 million 
   ($37 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability under  the New York ("NY") state Opioid Stewardship Act 
   ("OSA")  within  U.S.  Pharmaceutical  for  calendar  years  2017  and  2018.  In  December  2018,  a  federal  district  court 
   struck down the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY 
   covering calendar year 2019 sales and beyond. In September 2020, an appellate court reversed on procedural grounds 
   the district court’s decision. An amendment to the Act made clear that the OSA applies only to NY opioid sales or 
   distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. To the extent that further court decisions do not strike down the law, 
   we will face liability under the OSA and we believe the estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the 
   liability  is  retroactively  imposed  on  sales  or  distributions  in  2017  and  2018,  and  is  not  indicative  of  future  results. 
   Inclusion  of  this  accrual  in  our  adjusted  results  would  distort  current  period  performance.  This  charge  is  included 
   under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-
   GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by 
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the 
following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. 

•  Adjusted Gross Profit (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Gross Profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding transaction-

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses 
   and settlements; other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/
   or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

   Additionally,  the  Company's  investment  in  Change  Healthcare  Joint  Venture's  financial  results  are  adjusted  for  the 
   above noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted 
   results per diluted share. 

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
