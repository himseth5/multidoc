      SAN FRANCISCO, May 18, 2017 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) 
today reported that revenues for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017, were 
$48.7 billion, up 4% compared to $46.7 billion a year ago. On a constant 
currency basis, revenues increased 5% over the prior year. For the fiscal year, 
McKesson had revenues of $198.5 billion, up 4% compared to $190.9 billion a 
year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% over the prior 
year.  
      On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), 
fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $16.79, 
compared to $1.97 a year ago. Full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share from 
continuing operations was $23.28 compared to $9.84 a year ago, up 137% year-
over-year.  


                                   1 
       Fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP earnings included a pre-tax net gain of 
$3.9 billion, or $14.10 and $13.53 per diluted share, respectively, related to the 
 creation of the Change Healthcare joint venture, as disclosed on March 2, 2017.  
       Fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP and Adjusted Earnings included 
 charges of three cents and four cents per diluted share, respectively, related to 
 the company’s cost alignment plan that was announced in March 2016 (the “Cost 
 Alignment Plan”). Additionally, full-year GAAP and Adjusted Earnings included a 
 non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million, or $1.26 per 
 diluted share, taken in the second quarter related to the company’s Enterprise 
 Information Solutions (EIS) business within McKesson Technology Solutions 
 (MTS). 
       Excluding Cost Alignment Plan charges from Adjusted Earnings, fourth-
 quarter results of $3.42 per diluted share, were up 8% compared to $3.18 in the 
 prior year.  
       Excluding Cost Alignment Plan charges and the goodwill impairment 
 charge taken in the second quarter from Adjusted Earnings, full-year results of 
 $12.91 per diluted share, were up 3% compared to $12.52 in the prior year. 
       Fourth-quarter and full-year Fiscal 2016 GAAP and Adjusted Earnings 
 included pre-tax charges totaling $229 million, or approximately 73 cents per 
 diluted share, related to the Cost Alignment Plan.  
       Full-year Fiscal 2016 GAAP and Adjusted Earnings included pre-tax gains 
 of $103 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, related to the sale of two 
 businesses in the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2016.  
       “As we exit a challenging fiscal year, I am encouraged by our strong 
 fourth-quarter results,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive 
 officer. “Our Fiscal 2017 was impacted by both company-specific and industry 
 pressures. However, due to the actions we have taken, I believe we have 
 positioned our businesses well to address evolving market dynamics and to 
 capitalize on future growth opportunities.”  
       For the full year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $4.7 
 billion, and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion. During 
 the year, McKesson paid $4.2 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $2.3 billion of 


                                    2 
its common stock, repaid approximately $1.6 billion in long-term debt, invested 
$562 million internally and paid $253 million in dividends. 
      “Despite the difficult business environment, we were able to drive record 
operating cash flow results in Fiscal 2017,” Hammergren continued. “As a result 
of our strong cash generation, McKesson was able to deploy meaningful capital 
during the year, closing 11 acquisitions and returning more than $2.5 billion in 
cash to our shareholders. We were also pleased with the creation of Change 
Healthcare, which we believe will drive significant value for our shareholders.” 
        
Segment Results 
      Distribution Solutions revenues were $48.2 billion for the quarter, up 5% 
on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, 
Distribution Solutions revenues were $195.9 billion, up 4% on a reported basis 
and 5% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. 
      North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $40.6 
billion for the quarter were up 5% both on a reported and constant currency 
basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions, partially offset by 
branded to generic conversions. For the full year, North America pharmaceutical 
distribution and services revenues were $164.8 billion, up 4% on a reported and 
constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. 
      International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.1 
billion for the quarter, up 5% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency 
basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth. For the full year, International 
pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $24.8 billion, up 6% on a 
reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior 
year. 
      Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.6 billion for 
the quarter, up 9%, driven by market growth and an acquisition. For the full year, 
Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $6.2 billion, up 3% 
compared to the prior year. 
      Fourth-quarter Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $769 
million and GAAP operating margin was 1.60%. On a constant currency basis, 


                                   3 
fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior 
year, and the adjusted operating margin was 2.18%.  
      For the full year, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $3.4 
billion and GAAP operating margin was 1.72%. On a constant currency basis, 
full-year adjusted operating profit was $3.9 billion, down 9% from the prior year, 
and the adjusted operating margin was 1.99%. 
      Fourth quarter and full-year revenue and operating results of MTS were 
impacted by the creation of Change Healthcare, to which McKesson contributed 
the majority of its MTS businesses. As announced on March 2, 2017, McKesson 
will account for its equity share of Change Healthcare’s earnings on a one-month 
lag. Therefore, for the month of March, McKesson’s consolidated income 
statement contained neither the results of the MTS contributed businesses, nor 
any equity earnings from the new company.  
      MTS revenues of $0.5 billion were down 30% both on a reported and 
constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year, MTS revenues of 
$2.6 billion were down 10% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency 
basis.  
      Fourth-quarter MTS GAAP operating profit was $4.1 billion and full-year 
MTS GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion, both driven by the recognition of a 
gain related to the creation of Change Healthcare. On a constant currency basis, 
fourth-quarter adjusted operating profit was $99 million, down 3% from the prior 
year, and the adjusted operating margin was 19.30%.  
      For the full year, MTS’ adjusted operating profit was $303 million on a 
constant currency basis, and the adjusted operating margin was 11.60%. 
Excluding the second-quarter goodwill impairment charge related to our EIS 
business and credits related to the company’s Cost Alignment Plan, MTS’ 
adjusted operating profit was $584 million for the full year, and the adjusted 
operating margin was 22.38%. 
       
                         


                                   4 
Fiscal Year 2017 Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Earnings 
      Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $11.61 for the fiscal year ended 
March 31, 2017 excludes the following GAAP items: 
   •  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $1.39 per diluted 
      share; 
   •  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments of $13.03 per diluted share; 
   •  Claim and litigation reserve credits of two cents per diluted share for 
      average wholesale price litigation matters; and 
   •  LIFO inventory-related credits of one cent per diluted share. 
 
Revised Adjusted Earnings Definition and Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook  
      McKesson is revising its definition of Adjusted Earnings to closely align 
with management’s view of the company’s operating performance and portfolio of 
businesses. Please refer to the second 8-K filed today with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for the full description of each item included in our 
revised Adjusted Earnings definition, as well as a recast of Fiscal 2017 results. 
      On this revised basis, the company’s recast Fiscal 2017 Adjusted 
Earnings was $12.54 per diluted share. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2018, McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.10 to $8.80 and 
Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $11.75 to $12.45. “Our Fiscal 2018 
outlook incorporates headwinds related to the lapping effect of the competitive 
customer pricing environment and branded pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing 
trends, partially offset by our capital deployment efforts and solid growth across 
our businesses,” concluded Hammergren. 
 
Key Assumptions for Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook 
      The Fiscal 2018 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and is 
also subject to the Risk Factors outlined below: 
   •  Distribution Solutions revenue growth is expected to increase by mid-
      single digits driven by market growth and acquisitions. 
   •  We expect North America pharmaceutical distribution and services to 
      deliver mid-single digit revenue growth in Fiscal 2018. 


                                   5 
 •  International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues are 
    anticipated to grow mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in Fiscal 
   2018. 
•  Medical-Surgical distribution and services is expected to deliver mid-single 
    digit revenue growth in Fiscal 2018.  
 •  In the U.S. market, branded pharmaceutical manufacturer percentage 
    price increases are assumed to be in the mid-single digits in Fiscal 2018. 
 •  We expect a nominal contribution to our Fiscal 2018 results from generic 
    pharmaceuticals that increase in price. 
 •  We expect the profit contribution from the launch of new oral generic 
    pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market to be nominal.  
 •  We anticipate a full year contribution from Rite Aid of approximately $13 
    billion in annual revenues. 
 •  We assume that our ownership position in Celesio will continue to be 
    approximately 76% for Fiscal 2018. 
 •  We expect our Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin to be 
    between 198 basis points and 208 basis points. 
 •  Technology Solutions revenues, which reflects our Enterprise Information 
    Solutions (EIS) business, are expected to be between approximately $450 
    million and $500 million in Fiscal 2018. As previously disclosed, 
    McKesson is evaluating strategic alternatives for this business. 
 •  We expect adjusted equity earnings from our investment in Change 
    Healthcare to be between approximately $370 million and $430 million, 
    and that our ownership position in Change Healthcare will be 
    approximately 70% for Fiscal 2018. Equity earnings under GAAP will be 
    reported in the income statement line “Equity income or loss from Change 
    Healthcare”.  
 •  Corporate expenses are expected to be between approximately $435 
    million and $465 million in Fiscal 2018. 
 •  We expect our interest expense to decrease by approximately 10% 
    compared to Fiscal 2017. 


                                 6 
 •  The guidance range assumes a full-year adjusted tax rate of 
    approximately 27.0%, which may vary from quarter to quarter.  
 •  Income attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to increase 
   approximately 200% from Fiscal 2017, driven primarily by the joint 
   sourcing agreement with Walmart.  
•  We expect the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements will 
   have a net unfavorable impact of up to 5 cents per diluted share year-
    over-year.  
 •  Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures are expected 
    to be between $650 million and $750 million.  
 •  Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per 
    share are expected to be approximately 213 million for the year. 
 •  Cash flow from operations is expected to decline by approximately 10% 
    relative to the prior year, primarily due to a very strong Fiscal 2017 close 
    as well as the loss of the majority of MTS’ cash flow following the creation 
    of Change Healthcare. 
 •  Based on acquisitions announced as of March 31, 2017: 

       o  We expect amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of 
          approximately $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted share; 

       o  We expect acquisition expenses and related adjustments of $1.10 
          to $1.30 per diluted share; 

       o  We expect LIFO inventory-related charges of 20 cents to 60 cents 
          per diluted share; 

       o  We expect antitrust legal settlement credits of up to 4 cents per 
          diluted share; and 

       o  We expect restructuring charges of up to 5 cents per diluted share. 
 •  The Fiscal 2018 guidance range does not include the impact of any 
    potential new acquisitions and divestitures, or other adjustments, including 
    items such as impairments, gains or losses on disposal of assets or 
    potential claim or litigation reserve adjustments.

 Fiscal 2017 Adjusted Earnings 
       McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted 
 Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP 
 income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related 
 intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and 
 litigation reserve adjustments, reflecting the company’s reserves for controlled 
 substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation matters, and 
 Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments. A reconciliation of 
 McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in 
 Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 
  


                                    9 
 Constant Currency 
       McKesson also presents its financial results on a constant currency basis. 
 The company conducts business worldwide in local currencies, including the 
 Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of the 
 financial results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign 
 currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is presented to provide 
 a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The supplemental constant 
currency information of the company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted 
Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables 
included with this release.

                                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's financial results as determined by generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following non-GAAP measures in this press 
release. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its 
operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. 
Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those 
of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated 
differently by other companies in the same industry.

    • Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, 
      excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, certain claim and litigation 
      reserve adjustments and Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, as well as the related income tax effects. The Company 
      evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers 
      both the quantitative and qualitative aspect of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP 
      financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this 
      release.   
      Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets purchased or created in connection 
      with business acquisitions by the Company. 

      Acquisition expenses and related adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
      acquisitions and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange by the Company. Examples include transaction closing costs, 
      professional service fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments, employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-
      related expenses, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign 
      currency contracts and gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  

      Claim and litigation reserve adjustments - Adjustments to the Company’s reserves, including accrued interest if applicable, for estimated 
      probable losses for its Controlled Substance Distribution Claims and the Average Wholesale Price litigation matters, as such terms are 
      defined in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
      LIFO-related adjustments - Last-In-First-Out ("LIFO") inventory-related adjustments.

      Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” 
      which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    • Constant Currency (Non-GAAP): To present our financial results on a constant currency basis, we convert current year period results of 
      our oppgerations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars b yppygggyy applying the average foreign currency 
      exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on a constant currency basis, we 
      estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, 
      which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental constant currency information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and 
      Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The Company internally uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes.  Specifically, 
Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business 
performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business worldwide in local currencies, including Euro, British 
pound and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the 
estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the 
Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance 
with GAAP.
