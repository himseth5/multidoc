      “We delivered solid operating performance and we are pleased to report third-quarter adjusted 
earnings results ahead of our expectations,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “McKesson’s 
unwavering focus on strategic and operational execution is demonstrated in the adjusted operating profit 
growth we reported in the third quarter across our core operating segments. Additionally, we have 
deployed meaningful capital toward share repurchases year-to-date, delivering further value to our 
shareholders. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 Adjusted EPS remains unchanged from the prior guidance we 
provided on January 13th, 2020.”  
       
      Third-quarter revenues were $59.2 billion, up 5% from a year ago. On an FX-adjusted basis, 
revenues grew 6%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions 
segment, largely due to branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from retail national 
account customers. 
                         


                                          1 
 
      Third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.06 included a pre- and post-tax charge of $282 
million within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment for the remeasurement to fair value of 
assets and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint 
venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.  
       
      Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.81 compared to $3.40 a year ago, an 
increase of 12%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, Medical 
Surgical and European segments and a lower share count, partially offset by the previously anticipated 
increase in corporate expenses and a higher tax rate. Prior year third-quarter results included a pre-tax 
charge of $60 million related to a customer bankruptcy, partially offset by a $17 million pre-tax reversal of 
an accrued estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act. Excluding the impact 
of these prior year items from Adjusted Earnings, third-quarter adjusted results per diluted share 
increased approximately 7% year-over-year.  
       
      For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders 
via $1.9 billion of common stock repurchases and $222 million of dividend payments. During the first nine 
months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $280 million, and invested $338 
million internally, resulting in negative free cash flow of $618 million. 
 
U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $46.9 billion, up 6%, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical 
      price increases and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by 
      branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Third-quarter operating profit was $687 million and operating margin was 1.46%. Adjusted 
      operating profit was $658 million, up 11% from a year ago. Prior year third-quarter results 
      included a $60 million pre-tax charge related to a customer bankruptcy, partially offset by a $17 
      million pre-tax reversal of an accrued estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid 
      Stewardship Act. Excluding the net $43 million impact of these prior year items, adjusted 
      operating profit increased approximately 3%, driven by continued growth in the specialty 
      businesses. Adjusted operating margin was 1.40%, up 6 basis points. 
 
European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $6.9 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 3% on an FX-adjusted 
      basis, driven primarily by growth in the pharmaceutical distribution business. 
   •  Third-quarter operating loss was ($303 million) and operating margin was (4.37)%, primarily 
      driven by a pre- and post-tax charge of $282 million for the remeasurement to fair value of assets 
      and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint 
      venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Adjusted operating profit was $80 million, up 16%, and 
      adjusted operating margin was 1.15%. On an FX-adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit was 
      $82 million, up 19%, and adjusted operating margin was 1.16%, up 16 basis points, driven in part 
      by expense rationalization. 
                         


                                          2 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6%, driven primarily by growth in the Primary Care 
      business, largely due to higher pharmaceutical volumes and an early start to influenza season. 
   •  Third-quarter operating profit was $124 million and operating margin was 5.79%. Adjusted 
      operating profit was $184 million, up 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 8.59%, up 14 basis 
      points. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth in the Primary Care 
      business. 
 
Other remaining businesses 
   •  Third-quarter revenues were $3.2 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and up 5% on an FX-
      adjusted basis, primarily driven by growth in the Canadian business. 
   •  Third-quarter operating profit was $61 million. Adjusted operating profit was $214 million, down 
      4% on both a reported and FX-adjusted basis, as increased investment spend within the MRxTS 
      business was partially offset by growth in the Canadian business. 
       
Company Updates 
   •  On February 4, 2020, McKesson’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PF2 SpinCo, Inc., filed a registration 
      statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to a potential exit of the 
      company from its investment in the Change Healthcare joint venture. 
   •  McKesson was selected by the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue to serve as the prime 
      pharmaceutical provider when the current contract expires in August 2020.   
   •  On December 12, 2019, McKesson and Walgreens Boots Alliance announced an agreement to 
      create a joint venture that is expected to combine their respective pharmaceutical wholesale 
      businesses in Germany. 
   •  For the seventh year in a row, McKesson was honored as one of the “Best Places to Work for 
      LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, achieving 100 percent on 
      the HRC’s 2020 Corporate Equality Index (CEI). 
   •  McKesson appointed Nancy Flores as Executive Vice President, Chief Information and 
      Technology Officer effective January 13, 2020, following Kathy McElligott’s announced retirement. 
 
Fiscal 2020 Outlook 
   •  McKesson reaffirmed fiscal 2020 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance range of $14.60 
      to $14.80, which was previously narrowed and raised from $14.00 to $14.60 on January 13, 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Earnings, FX-
Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with 
GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying 
financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial 
measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
      The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is 
unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most 
directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson 
cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements 
      Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute 
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and 
uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as 
references to the expected joint venture in Germany, which speak only as of the date they are first made. 
Except to the extent required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as 
“believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, 
“estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial 
trends, strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We 
encourage investors to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q 
and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risk factors include, but 
are not limited to: changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environment; fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates; the impact of the Change Healthcare joint venture on the company’s results of 
operations; the company’s ability to manage and complete divestitures and distributions; material 
adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings, including those related to the distribution of controlled 
substances; cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction of sophisticated internal computer systems to 
perform as designed; and the potential inadequacy of insurance to cover property loss or liability claims.

(a)  Calculated as "Net Income (Loss) Attributable to McKesson Corporation" less "Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax" as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations - GAAP.
(b)  Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments.
(c)  We calculate GAAP net loss per diluted share for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 using a weighted average of 183 million common shares, which excludes dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive 
     effect when calculating a net loss per diluted share. We calculate Adjusted Earnings per diluted share (Non-GAAP) for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 on a fully diluted basis, using a weighted average of 184 million common 
     shares. Because we show the GAAP to Non-GAAP per share reconciling items on a fully diluted basis, any cross-footing differences in those items are due to different weighted average share counts.
(d)  Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis for fiscal 2020 was $10.74, which excludes the foreign currency exchange effect of $0.03.

                         SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally 
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-
GAAP measures in this press release. The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental 
information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial 
performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP 
measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the 
Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the 
same industry.

•   Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to 
    McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, last-in, 
    first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related 
    charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company 
    evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation 
    considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation 
    of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial 
    statement tables included with this release.

    Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
    combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

    Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business 
    combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering 
    costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, retention payments 
    and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred 
    revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge 
    loan fees, and gains or losses on business combinations and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued 
    operations.

    LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

    Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

    Restructuring, impairment and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our 
    operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as 
    well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or 
    consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and 
    other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, 
    reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration 
    of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring 
    charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit 
    adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from Adjusted Earnings.

    Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an 
    individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, 
    other adjustments may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; 
    other asset impairments; certain discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment 
    of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent 
    items as deemed appropriate. Prior to fiscal 2020, this category also included certain gains or losses from divestitures of 
    businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations.

    Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, 
    “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

    Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted 
    items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted earnings per diluted 
    share.
                                                                                                      2 of 2

                    SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•   FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial 
    results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are 
    recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable 
    prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign 
    currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from 
    quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings 
    (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•   Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments 
    for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated statements 
    of cash flows. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019, free cash flow was $(618) million, calculated as $(280) million 
    net cash used in operating activities less $(242) million in payments for property, plant and equipment and $(96) million in 
    payments for capitalized software expenditures. For the nine months ended December 31, 2018, free cash flow was $(264) 
    million, calculated as $141 million net cash provided by operating activities less $(309) million in payments for property, 
    plant and equipment and $(96) million in payments for capitalized software expenditures. We believe free cash flow is important 
    to management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
    needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments or other strategic uses of cash.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and 
reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, 
deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses 
internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of 
our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted 
information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not 
be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
