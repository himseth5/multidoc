      "Our enterprise strategy is enabling us to successfully navigate a dynamic environment. McKesson 
delivered strong second-quarter results, including double-digit Adjusted Operating Profit growth across all 
segments," said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. "We remain committed to investing in our growth 
strategies of biopharma services and oncology ecosystems, while simultaneously increasing shareholder 
returns.”  

 
 

      “We continue to play a central role in the COVID-19 response efforts. As a result of our strong first 
half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous guidance range for 
fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share to $21.95 to $22.55.” 
       
      Second-quarter revenues were $66.6 billion, an increase of 9% from a year ago, driven by growth in 
the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to increased specialty volumes and market growth, partially 
offset by branded to generic conversions. 
       
      Second-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.71 included an after-tax 
charge of $472 million primarily for the fair value remeasurement related to McKesson’s sale of certain 
European businesses to the PHOENIX Group. McKesson also incurred an after-tax loss of $141 million on 
debt extinguishment related to a recent tender offer in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Second-quarter 
Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share does not include these charges. 
       
      Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share was $6.15 compared to $4.80 a year ago, an 
increase of 28%, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage 
programs with the U.S. government and growth in the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset 
by a higher tax rate compared to the prior year. Second-quarter Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share also 
included pre-tax net gains of approximately $97 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, associated with 
McKesson Ventures' equity investments, compared to $49 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.  
 
      For the first six months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders, 
which included $1.3 billion of common stock repurchases and $134 million of dividend payments. During the 
first six months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $170 million, and invested 
$279 million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative Free Cash Flow of $109 million. 
 
Business Highlights 
   •  U.S. Pharmaceutical’s operational excellence and capabilities was demonstrated by the successful 
      shipment of over 311 million COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of the U.S. government through October 
      28, 2021, including vaccine distribution in the U.S. and related to the U.S. government’s international 
      donation mission. 
   •  Medical-Surgical Solutions recently expanded its partnership with the U.S. government to support 
      the COVID-19 response efforts through an additional kitting and storage contract of COVID-19 
      ancillary supplies. 
   •  McKesson continued to progress in its planned exit from Europe: 
         ◦  Announced on November 1, 2021 an agreement to sell its retail and distribution businesses 
            in the U.K. to Aurelius. 
         ◦  Recorded after-tax loss of $472 million related to the previously announced agreement to sell 
            businesses in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia to the PHOENIX Group. 
 
                         


      
 

U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by increased specialty 
      volumes and market growth, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $760 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $735 million, an increase of 12%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers 
      and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution. 
 
Prescription Technology Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher volumes of 
      technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers and growth of prescription 
      volumes. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $128 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $144 million, an increase of 38%, driven by core growth from access and adherence solutions. 
 
Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23%, driven by increased sales of 
      COVID-19 tests and growth in the primary care business. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Profit was $296 million. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was 
      $319 million, an increase of 52%, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests, improvements in 
      primary care patient visits, and the contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary 
      supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. 
 
International Segment 
   •  Second-quarter revenues were $9.1 billion. On an FX-Adjusted basis, revenues were $8.8 billion, a 
      decline of 8%, driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint 
      venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, 
      partially offset by volume recovery in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses. 
   •  Second-quarter Segment Operating Loss was ($146) million. On an FX-Adjusted basis, Adjusted 
      Segment Operating Profit was $155 million, an increase of 34%, driven by the discontinued 
      recording of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets included in the transaction 
      with the PHOENIX Group, which were classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 
      fiscal 2022. 
 
Company Updates  
   •  Dr. Richard H. Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General, joined McKesson's Board of Directors as a 
      new independent director and member of the Board of Directors' Compensation and Compliance 
      Committees effective September 6, 2021. 
   •  On September 4, 2021, McKesson announced that, under the previously announced proposed 
      settlement agreement and process designed to resolve the opioid claims of state and local 
      governmental entities, it was determined that enough states have agreed to settle to proceed to the 
      next phase. 
   •  On September 28, 2021, McKesson announced that an agreement was reached with the Cherokee 
      Nation. This settlement was negotiated in connection with ongoing negotiations toward a broad 
      resolution of opioid-related claims brought by Native American tribes that, as previously disclosed by 
      the companies, are not covered by the ongoing settlement process involving state and local 
      governmental entities. 

      
 

Fiscal 2022 Outlook 
            McKesson raised fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance to $21.95 to $22.55 
from the previous range of $19.80 to $20.40 to reflect strong operating performance and increased 
contribution from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs.  
    
      Fiscal 2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share guidance includes approximately $2.30 to $3.05 of 
impacts, which are attributable to: 
   •  $1.30 to $1.80 related to the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage 
      programs; 
   •  $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and impairments for personal protective equipment and 
      related products; 
   •  $0.49 related to year-to-date gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures’ equity 
      investments.  
       
      Excluding the impacts of the above items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, 
indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth. 
 
      Additional modeling considerations will be provided in the earnings call presentation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes 
GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Gross Profit, 
Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Other Income, Adjusted Loss on Debt Extinguishment, Adjusted 
Income Tax Expense, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share, Adjusted Segment 
Operating Profit, Adjusted Segment Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted Corporate Expenses, Adjusted 
Operating Profit, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in 
accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the 

      
 

accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP 
financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP 
financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 
      The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable 
to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking Non-GAAP measure to the most directly 
comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot 
reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, certain litigation loss and gain contingencies, 
restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and 
estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond 
the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could 
vary materially. 
 
Cautionary Statements 
      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements 
may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, “will”, 
“should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “projects,” “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words 
or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial outlook, trends, strategy, plans, assumptions, 
or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements, such as financial performance forecasts, which speak only as of the date they 
are first made. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise our 
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied. Although it is not possible to 
predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, we encourage investors to read the risk factors described 
in our most recent annual and periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
      These risk factors include, but are not limited to: we experience costly and disruptive legal disputes 
and settlements, including regarding our role in distributing controlled substances such as opioids; we might 
experience losses not covered by insurance; we might be adversely impacted by changes in tax legislation 
or challenges to our tax positions; we from time to time record significant charges from impairment to 
goodwill, intangibles, inventory and other assets or investments; we experience cybersecurity incidents and 
might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches; we might experience 
significant problems with information systems or networks; we may be unsuccessful in retail pharmacy 
profitability; we might be harmed by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-
renewal; our contracts with government entities involve future funding and compliance risks; we might be 
harmed by changes in our relationships or contracts with suppliers; we might be adversely impacted by 
delays or other difficulties with divestitures; we might be adversely impacted by healthcare reform such as 
changes in pricing and reimbursement models; we might be adversely impacted by changes or disruptions 
in product supply and we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and 
changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; we might be adversely 
impacted as a result of our distribution of generic pharmaceuticals; we might be adversely impacted by an 
economic slowdown (including the effects we have experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic) or recession 
and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access to credit, increase our 
borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; we might be adversely 
impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we might be adversely impacted by events 
outside of our control, such as widespread public health issues (including the effects we have experienced 
from the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, political events and other catastrophic events; we may be 

      
 

adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; 
and we face uncertainties and risks related to COVID-19 vaccination mandates and to vaccination 
distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs.

                                 FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES

(2) Transaction-related expenses and adjustments for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax 
   charges of $491 million ($472 million after-tax) to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs

   remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell, to impair certain internal-use software that 
   will not be utilized in the future, and the effect of accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with 
   the disposal group are included within our International segment. These charges are included under "total operating 
   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(3) Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax 
   charges of $32 million ($24 million after-tax) primarily for Corporate expenses, net as well as U.S. Pharmaceutical, 
   and for the six months ended September 30, 2021 pre-tax charges of $190 million ($153 million after-tax), primarily 
   for Corporate expenses, net as well as our Canada and Europe businesses. The three and six months ended September

   primarily for our Europe business and Corporate expenses, net. Our Europe and Canada businesses are included within 
   International. These charges are included under "total operating expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables. Additionally, restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the three and six months ended September 
   30,  2020  includes  immaterial  amounts  under  “gross  profit”  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP  operating 
   results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables. 

(4) Claims and litigation charges, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of 
   $112 million ($93 million after-tax) related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims of government entities, 
   including Native American tribes, within Corporate expenses, net. These charges are included under "total operating 
   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(5) Claims  and  litigation  charges,  net  for  the  six  months  ended  September  30,  2021  includes  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $27 
   million ($22 million after-tax) related to an agreement to settle opioid-related claims with the State of New York and 
   its participating subdivisions, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and a pre-tax charge of $47 million ($39 million 
   after-tax) related to our estimated liability for a comprehensive proposed agreement to settle opioid-related claims of 
   participating states, their political subdivisions, and other government entities, within Corporate expenses, net. These

   adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.

(6) Claims and litigation charges, net for the six months ended September 30, 2020 includes a pre-tax net gain of $131

   plaintiffs' counsel, in connection with the $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our

   expenses" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in 
   Schedule 2 of the accompanying financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  2 of 2

                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES (continued)

(7) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 includes a pre-tax loss of $191 million 
   ($141  million  after-tax)  on  debt  extinguishment  related  to  our  July  2021  tender  offer  to  redeem  a  portion  of  our 
   existing debt. This charge is included under "loss on debt extinguishment" in the reconciliation of McKesson's GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables.

(8) Other adjustments, net for the six months ended September 30, 2021 includes pre-tax charges of $155 million ($118 
   million after-tax) related to inventory write downs on certain excess personal protective equipment within Medical-
   Surgical  Solutions.  These  charges  are  driven  by  the  intent  of  management  to  not  sell  this  excess  inventory  which 
   required inventory write downs to zero net realizable value, and instead direct it to charitable organizations. A portion 
   of this inventory was committed for donation during our first quarter of fiscal 2022. Due to the nature of this expected 
   in-kind donation of inventory in a quantitatively significant amount, management believes this charge is not part of 
   normal business operations and is therefore excluded from our determination of adjusted results. A pre-tax charge of 
   $147 million ($112 million after-tax) is included under "gross profit" primarily related to the excess inventory, which 
   we  no  longer  plan  to  sell  and  instead  plan  to  donate,  and  a  pre-tax  charge  of  $8  million  ($6  million  after-tax)  is 
   included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  related  to  the  already  committed  donation  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.

(9) Other  adjustments,  net  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  September  30,  2020  includes  a  non-cash  goodwill 
   impairment charge of $69 million (pre-tax and after-tax) within International related to our European retail business, 
   partially offset by the related indirect effect of $4 million benefit in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
   This  impairment  charge  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of  McKesson's  GAAP 
   operating  results  to  adjusted  results  (Non-GAAP)  provided  in  Schedule  2  of  the  accompanying  financial  statement 
   tables.

(10) Other adjustments, net for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 include a pre-tax charge of $50 million 
   ($37  million  after-tax)  related  to  our  estimated  liability  under  the  New  York  ("NY")  state  Opioid  Stewardship  Act 
   ("OSA")  within  U.S.  Pharmaceutical  for  calendar  years  2017  and  2018.  In  December  2018,  a  federal  district  court 
   struck down the law as unconstitutional and NY replaced the OSA with an excise tax on opioid sales in the state of NY 
   covering calendar year 2019 sales and beyond. In September 2020, an appellate court reversed on procedural grounds 
   the district court’s decision. An amendment to the Act made clear that the OSA applies only to NY opioid sales or 
   distributions for calendar years 2017 and 2018. On October 4, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court denied further review, 
   and,  as  a  result,  we  anticipate  facing  liability  under  the  OSA  for  calendar  years  2017  and  2018.  We  believe  the 
   estimated OSA liability is one-time in nature because the liability is retroactively imposed on sales or distributions in 
   2017 and 2018, and is not indicative of future results. Inclusion of this accrual in our adjusted results would distort 
   current  period  performance.  This  charge  is  included  under  "total  operating  expenses"  in  the  reconciliation  of 
   McKesson's GAAP operating results to adjusted results (Non-GAAP) provided in Schedule 2 of the accompanying 
   financial statement tables.
                                                                                                  1 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

   The following provides further details regarding the adjustments made to our GAAP financial results to arrive at our 
   Non-GAAP measures as defined above:

   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business 
   combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

   Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration, and other expenses that are directly related to 
   business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures, and other transaction-related costs including initial 
   public  offering  costs.  Examples  include  transaction  closing  costs,  professional  service  fees,  legal  fees,  severance 
   charges,  retention  payments  and  employee  relocation  expenses,  facility  or  other  exit-related  expenses,  certain  fair 
   value  adjustments  including  deferred  revenues,  contingent  consideration  and  inventory,  recoveries  of  acquisition-
   related  expenses  or  post-closing  expenses,  bridge  loan  fees  and  gains  or  losses  on  business  combinations,  and 
   divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

   LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

   Gains  from  antitrust  legal  settlements  -  Net  cash  proceeds  representing  the  Company’s  share  of  antitrust  lawsuit 
   settlements.

   Restructuring,  impairment,  and  related  charges  -  Restructuring  charges  that  are  incurred  for  programs  in  which  we 
   change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business 
   is  conducted  as  well  as  long-lived  asset  impairments.  Such  charges  may  include  employee  severance,  retention 
   bonuses,  facility  closure  or  consolidation  costs,  lease  or  contract  termination  costs,  asset  impairments,  accelerated 
   depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the 
   sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, 
   realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. 
   The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include 
   normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also 
   excluded from adjusted results.

   Claims and litigation charges - Adjustments to certain of the Company’s reserves, including those related to estimated 
   probable settlements for its controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any 
   applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal 
   fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred.

   Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively 
   on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our adjusted results from time to time. While not 
   all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: other asset impairments; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and 
   other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.

   The Company evaluates the aforementioned Non-GAAP measures on a periodic basis and updates the definitions from 
   time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of 
   Non-GAAP adjusted results. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is 
   provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•  FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) on 
   an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results 
   of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average 
   foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 
   on  an  FX-Adjusted  basis,  we  estimate  the  impact  of  foreign  currency  rate  fluctuations  on  the  Company’s 
   noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental 
   FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and adjusted results (Non-GAAP) is provided in 
   Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.
                                                                                                  3 of 3

                 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less 
   payments  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  capitalized  software  expenditures,  as  disclosed  in  our  condensed 
   consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  A  reconciliation  of  McKesson’s  GAAP  financial  results  to  Free  Cash  Flow 
   (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 6 of the financial statement tables included with this release. 

The  Company  believes  the  presentation  of  Non-GAAP  measures  provides  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors 
with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the 
Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists 
investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's 
Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same 
industry.

The  Company  internally  uses  both  GAAP  and  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  in  connection  with  its  own  financial 
planning  and  reporting  processes.  Management  utilizes  Non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  allocating  resources, 
deploying  capital,  as  well  as  assessing  business  performance,  and  determining  employee  incentive  compensation.  The 
Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian 
dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed 
excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe free cash flow is important to 
management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital 
needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, or other strategic uses of cash. Nonetheless, 
Non-GAAP  adjusted  results  and  related  Non-GAAP  measures  disclosed  by  the  Company  should  not  be  considered  a 
substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
